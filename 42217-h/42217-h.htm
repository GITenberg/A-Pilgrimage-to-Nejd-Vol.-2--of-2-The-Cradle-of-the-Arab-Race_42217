Saoud&rsquo;s stud&mdash;The stables at Ha&iuml;l&mdash;Some
notes of individual mares&mdash;The points of a Nejd

for training.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">chapter</span> on the horses we saw at
Ha&iuml;l has been promised, and may as well be given here.</p>
<p>Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s stud is now the most celebrated in Arabia,
and has taken the place in public estimation of that stud of
Feysul ibn Saoud&rsquo;s which Mr. Palgrave saw sixteen years ago
at Riad, and which he described in the picturesque paragraphs
which have since been constantly quoted.&nbsp; The cause of this
transference of supremacy from Aared to Jebel Shammar, lies in
the political changes which have occurred since 1865, and which
have taken the leadership of Central Arabia out of the hands of
the Ibn Saouds and put it into those of the Emirs of
Ha&iuml;l.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Mohammed
ibn Rashid is now not only the most powerful of Bedouin sheykhs,
but the richest prince in Arabia; and as such has better means
than any other of acquiring the best horses of Nejd, nor have
these been neglected by him.</p>
<p>The possession of thoroughbred mares is always among the Arabs
a symbol of power; and with the loss of their supreme position in
Nejd, the Ibn Saouds have lost their command of the market, and
their stud has been allowed to dwindle.&nbsp; The quarrels of the
two brothers, Abdallah and Saoud, sons of Feysul, on their
father&rsquo;s death, their alternate victories and flights from
the capital, and the ruin wrought on them both by the Turks,
broke up an establishment which depended on wealth and security
for its maintenance; and at the present moment, if common report
speaks true, hardly a twentieth part of the old stud remains at
Riad.&nbsp; The rest have passed into other hands.</p>
<p>That Feysul&rsquo;s stud in its day was the best in Arabia is
probable, and it may be that no collection now to be found there
has an equal merit; but there seems little reason for supposing
that it differed in anything but degree from what we ourselves
saw, or that the animals composing it were distinct from those
still owned by the various Bedouin tribes of Nejd.&nbsp; All our
inquiries, on the contrary (and we spared no occasion of asking
questions), tend to show that it is a mistake to suppose that the
horses kept by the Emirs of Riad were a <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>special breed, preserved in the towns
of Aared from time immemorial, or that they differed in any way
from those bred elsewhere in Central Arabia.&nbsp; They were, we
were repeatedly assured, a collection recruited from the various
tribes of the Nef&ucirc;ds,&mdash;a very fine collection, no
doubt, but still a collection.&nbsp; Every Bedouin we have asked
has laughed at the idea of there being a special <i>Nejd
breed</i>, only found in Aared.&nbsp; In answer to our questions
we were informed that in Feysul&rsquo;s time emissaries from Riad
were constantly on the look-out for mares wherever they could
find them; and that the Emir had often made ghaz&uacute;s against
this and that tribe, with no other object than the possession of
a particular animal, of a particular breed.&nbsp; The tribe from
which he got the best blood, the Hamdani Simri and the Kehilan
el-Krush, was the Muteyr (sometimes called the Dushan), while the
Beni Khaled, Dafir, Shammar, and even the &Aacute;nazeh, supplied
him with occasional specimens.&nbsp; Abdallah ibn Saoud, his
successor, still retains a few of them, but the bulk of the
collection was dispersed, many of the best passing into the hands
of Metaab and Bender, Mohammed ibn Rashid&rsquo;s
predecessors.&nbsp; Mohammed himself follows precisely the same
system, except that he does not take by force, but on
payment.&nbsp; He makes purchases from all the tribes around, and
though he breeds in the town, his collection is constantly
recruited from without.&nbsp; Were this not the case, no doubt,
it would soon degenerate, as <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>town-bred horses in Arabia, being
stall-fed and getting no sort of exercise, are seldom fit for
much.&nbsp; There is a false notion that the oases, such as those
of Jebel Shammar and Aared, are spots especially adapted for the
rearing of horses, and that the sandy wastes outside contain no
pasture.&nbsp; But the very reverse of this is the case.&nbsp;
The oases in which the towns stand, produce nothing but date
palms and garden produce, nor is there a blade of grass, or even
a tuft of camel pasture in their neighbourhood.&nbsp; The
townspeople keep no animals except a few camels used for working
the wells, and now and then a donkey.&nbsp; Even these must be
fed either on corn or dates, which none but the rich can
afford.&nbsp; Horses are a luxury reserved only for princes, and
even the richest citizens do their travelling from village to
village on foot.&nbsp; Longer journeys are performed on
dromedaries brought in from the desert for the purpose, which are
either the property of Bedouins or held with them by the citizens
on shares.</p>
<p>The Nef&ucirc;ds, on the other hand, contain pasture in
abundance, not only for camels, but for sheep and horses, and it
is in the Nef&ucirc;ds that all these are bred.&nbsp; Ibn Rashid
goes every spring with the bulk of his live stock to the desert,
and leaves them during part of the summer with the tribes, only a
few animals being reserved for use in the town.&nbsp; It cannot
be too strongly insisted upon, that the upper plateaux of Nejd,
where the towns and villages <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>are found, are a stony wilderness
almost entirely devoid of vegetation, while the Nef&ucirc;ds
afford an inexhaustible supply of pasture.&nbsp; The want of
water alone limits the pastoral value of these, for the inhabited
area is necessarily confined to a radius of twenty or thirty
miles round each well,&mdash;and wells are rare.&nbsp; These
facts have not, I think, been hitherto sufficiently known to be
appreciated.</p>
<p>With regard to Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s collection at Ha&iuml;l we
looked it over three or four times in the stables, and saw it out
once on a gala day, when each animal was made to look its
best.&nbsp; The stables consist of four open yards communicating
with each other, in which the animals stand tethered each to a
square manger of sun-dried brick.&nbsp; They are not sheltered in
any way, but wear long heavy rugs fastened across the
chest.&nbsp; They are chained by one or more feet to the ground,
and wear no headstalls.&nbsp; It being winter time and they
ungroomed, they were all in the roughest possible condition, and,
as has been mentioned, our first impression was one of
disappointment.&nbsp; When at Ha&iuml;l they are given no regular
exercise, remaining it would seem for weeks together tied up
thus, except for a few minutes in the evening, when they are led
to drink.&nbsp; They are fed almost entirely on dry barley.&nbsp;
In the spring only, for a few weeks, they eat green corn grown on
purpose, and then are taken to the Nef&ucirc;d or on
ghaz&uacute;s.&nbsp; It is surprising that <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>they should be
able to do their work under such conditions.</p>
<p>The first yard one enters in going through the stables,
contained, when we saw them, from twenty-five to thirty
mares.&nbsp; In the second were twenty more, kept in a certain
kind of condition for service in case of necessity; but even
these get very little exercise.&nbsp; As they stand there in the
yard, slovenly and unkempt, they have very little of that air of
high breeding one would expect; and it requires considerable
imagination to look upon them as indeed the <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of breeding in Arabia.&nbsp; We made the mistake, too common, of
judging horses by condition, for, mounted and in motion, these at
once became transfigured.</p>
<p>Here may follow some descriptions of particular animals,
written after one of our visits to the stud; these will give a
better idea of them than any general remarks.&nbsp; In our notes
I find:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; A chestnut Keh&icirc;let el-Krush with three
white feet (mutlak el-yemin), 14 hands, or 14&middot;1, but very
powerful.&nbsp; Her head is plainer than most here&mdash;it would
be thought a good head in England&mdash;lean and rather
narrow.&nbsp; She has too heavy a neck, but a very fine shoulder,
a high wither, legs like steel, hind quarter decidedly coarse,
much hair at the heels.&nbsp; More bone than breeding, one is
inclined to say, seeing her at her manger, though moving, and
with the Emir on her back, one must <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>be very captious not to admire.&nbsp;
She is Mohammed&rsquo;s favourite charger, and of the best blood
in Nejd.&nbsp; Ibn Rashid got this strain from Ibn Saoud&rsquo;s
stables at Riad, but it came originally from the
Muteyr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; A bay Hamdanieh Simri, also from Ibn
Saoud&rsquo;s collection, a pretty head, but no other
distinction.&nbsp; N.B.&nbsp; This mare is of the same strain as
our own mare Sherifa, but inferior to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; A grey Seglawieh Sheyfi, extremely plain at
first sight, with very drooping quarters, and a head in no way
remarkable, but with a fine shoulder.&nbsp; This Seglawieh Sheyfi
has a great reputation here, and is of special interest as being
the last of her race, the only descendant of the famous mare
bought by Abbas Pasha, who sent a bullock cart from Egypt all the
way to Nejd to fetch her, for she was old, and unable to travel
on foot.&nbsp; The story is well known here, and was told to us
exactly as we heard it in the north, with the addition that this
mare of Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s is the only representative of the
strain left in Arabia.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; A dark bay Keh&icirc;let Ajuz, quite
14&middot;2, one white foot, really splendid in every point,
shoulder quarter and all; the handsomest head and largest eye of
any here.&nbsp; She has ideal action, head and <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>tail carried to
perfection, and recalls Beteyen ibn Mershid&rsquo;s mare, but her
head is finer.&nbsp; She belongs to Ham&uacute;d, who is very
proud of her, and tells us she came from the Jerba Shammar.&nbsp;
It surprises us to find here a mare from Mesopotamia; but we are
told that interchange of horses between the southern and northern
Shammar is by no means rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; A dark brown Keh&icirc;let Ajuz, no white
except an inch in breadth just above one hoof, lovely head and
thoroughbred appearance, and for style of galloping perhaps the
best here, although less powerful than the Emir&rsquo;s chestnut
and Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s bay.&nbsp; It is hard to choose among
the three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the eight horses, the best is a Shueyman Sbah of
great power, head large and very fine.&nbsp; He reminds us of
Faris Jerba&rsquo;s mare of the same strain of blood; they are
probably related closely, for he has much the same points,
forequarter perfect, hindquarter strong but less
distinguished.&nbsp; He was bred, however, in Nejd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A grey Seglawi Jedran, from Ibn Ned&eacute;ri of the
Gomussa &Aacute;nazeh, is a poor specimen of that great strain of
blood; but the Bedouin respect for it prevails here though they
have now no pure Seglawi Jedrans in Nejd.&nbsp; It is interesting
to find this horse valued here, as the fact proves that the
&Aacute;nazeh horses are thought much of in Nejd.&nbsp; The more
one sees of the Nejd horses here, the more is one convinced of
the superiority of those of the &Aacute;nazeh in <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the points of
speed, and, proud as every one here is of the &lsquo;kheyl
Nejdi,&rsquo; it seems to be acknowledged that in these points
they are surpassed by the &Aacute;nazeh horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our own &Aacute;nazeh mares are looked upon as
prodigies of speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In comparing what we see here, with what we saw last
year in the north, the first thing that strikes us is that these
are ponies, the others horses.&nbsp; It is not so much the actual
difference in height, though there must be quite three inches on
an average, as the shape, which produces this impression.&nbsp;
The Nejd horses have as a rule shorter necks and shorter bodies,
and stand over far less ground than the &Aacute;nazehs.&nbsp;
Then, although their shoulders are undoubtedly good and their
withers higher than one generally sees further north, the
hind-quarter is short, and if it were not for the peculiarly
handsome carriage of the tail would certainly want
distinction.&nbsp; Their legs all seem to be extremely good; but
we have not seen in one of them that splendid line of the hind
leg to the hock which is so striking in the &Aacute;nazeh
thoroughbreds.&nbsp; Of their feet it is difficult to judge, for
from long standing without exercise, all the Emir&rsquo;s mares
have their hoofs overgrown.&nbsp; Their manes and tails are
thicker than one would expect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In their heads, however, there is certainly a general
superiority to the &Aacute;nazeh mares, at least in all the
points the Arabs most admire, and we were <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>both struck,
directly we saw them, with the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As I may fairly assume that few persons out of Arabia have an
idea what are there considered the proper points of a
horse&rsquo;s head, I will give here a description of them:</p>
<p>First of all, the head should be large, not small.&nbsp; A
little head the Arabs particularly dislike, but the size should
be all in the upper regions of the skull.&nbsp; There should be a
great distance from the ears to the eyes, and a great distance
from one eye to the other, though not from ear to ear.&nbsp; The
forehead, moreover, and the whole region between and just below
the eyes, should be convex, the eyes themselves standing rather
&ldquo;<i>&agrave; fleur de t&ecirc;te</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
there should be nothing fleshy about their prominence, and each
bone should be sharply edged; a flat forehead is disliked.&nbsp;
The space round the eyes should be free of all hair, so as to
show the black skin underneath, and this just round the eyes
should be especially black and lustrous.&nbsp; The cheek-bone
should be deep and lean, and the jaw-bone clearly marked.&nbsp;
Then the face should narrow suddenly and run down almost to a
point, not however to such a point as one sees in the English
racehorse, whose profile seems to terminate with the nostril, but
to the tip of the lip.&nbsp; The nostril when in repose should
lie flat with the face, appearing in it little more than a slit,
and pinched and puckered up, as also should the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>mouth, which
should have the under-lip longer than the upper, &ldquo;like the
camel&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the Bedouins say.&nbsp; The ears,
especially in the mare, should be long, but fine and delicately
cut, like the ears of a gazelle.</p>
<p>It must be remarked that the head and the tail are the two
points especially regarded by Arabs in judging of a horse, as in
them they think they can discover the surest signs of his
breeding.&nbsp; The tails of the Nejd horses are as peculiar as
their heads, and are as essential to their beauty.&nbsp; However
other points might differ, every horse at Ha&iuml;l had its tail
set on in the same fashion, in repose something like the tail of
a rocking horse, and not as has been described, &ldquo;thrown out
in a perfect arch.&rdquo;&nbsp; In motion the tail was held high
in the air, and looked as if it could not under any circumstances
be carried low.&nbsp; Mohammed ibn Ar&ucirc;k declared roundly
that the phenomenon was an effect, partly at least, of art.&nbsp;
He assured us that before a foal is an hour old, its tail is bent
back over a stick and the twist produces a permanent
result.&nbsp; But this sounds unlikely, and in any case it could
hardly affect the carriage of the tail in galloping.</p>
<p>With regard to colour, of the hundred animals in the Ha&iuml;l
stables, there were about forty greys or rather whites, thirty
bays, twenty chestnuts, and the rest brown.&nbsp; We did not see
a real black, and of course there are no roans, or piebalds, or
duns, <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>for
these are not Arab colours.&nbsp; The Emir one day asked us what
colours we preferred in England, and when we told him bay or
chestnut he quite agreed with us.&nbsp; Nearly all Arabs prefer
bay with black points, though pure white with a very black skin
and hoofs is also liked.&nbsp; In a bay or chestnut, three white
feet, the off fore-foot being dark, are not objected to.&nbsp;
But, as a rule, colour is not much regarded at Ha&iuml;l, for
there as elsewhere in Arabia a fashionable strain is all in
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the full grown animals, Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s
yards contain thirty or forty foals and yearlings, beautiful
little creatures but terribly starved and miserable.&nbsp; Foals
bred in the desert are poor enough, but these in town have a
positively sickly appearance.&nbsp; Tied all day long by the foot
they seem to have quite lost heart, and show none of the
playfulness of their age.&nbsp; Their tameness, like that of the
&ldquo;fowl and the brute,&rdquo; is shocking to see.&nbsp; The
Emir tells us that every spring he sends a hundred yearlings down
to Queyt on the Persian Gulf under charge of one of his slaves,
who sells them at Bombay for &pound;100 apiece.&nbsp; They are of
course now at their worst age, but they have the prospect of a
few months&rsquo; grazing in the Nef&ucirc;d before appearing in
the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the whole, both of us are rather disappointed with
what we see here.&nbsp; Of all the mares in the prince&rsquo;s
stables I do not think more than three or four could show with
advantage among the Gomussa, <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and, in fact, we are somewhat alarmed
lest the Emir should propose an exchange with us for our chestnut
Ras el-Fedawi which is greatly admired by every one.&nbsp; If he
did, we could not well refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to Nejd horses in general, the following remarks
are based on what we saw and heard at Ha&iuml;l, and elsewhere in
Arabia.</p>
<p>First, whatever may have been the case formerly, horses of any
kind are now exceedingly rare in Nejd.&nbsp; One may travel vast
distances in the Peninsula without meeting a single horse or even
crossing a horse track.&nbsp; Both in the Nef&ucirc;d and on our
return journey to the Euphrates, we carefully examined every
track of man and beast we met; but from the time of our leaving
the Roala till close to Meshhed Ali, not twenty of these proved
to be tracks of horses.&nbsp; The wind no doubt obliterates
footsteps quickly, but it could not wholly do so, if there were a
great number of the animals near.&nbsp; The Ketherin, a true Nejd
tribe and a branch of the Beni Khaled, told us with some pride
that they could mount a hundred horsemen, and even the Muteyr,
reputed to be the greatest breeders of thoroughbred stock in
Nejd, are said to possess only 400 mares.&nbsp; The horse is a
luxury with the Bedouins of the Peninsula, and not, as it is with
those of the North, a necessity of their daily life.&nbsp; Their
journeys and raids and wars are all made on camel, not on
horse-back; and at most the Sheykh mounts his mare at the <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>moment of
battle.&nbsp; The want of water in Nejd is a sufficient reason
for this.&nbsp; Horses there are kept for show rather than actual
use, and are looked upon as far too precious to run unnecessary
risks.</p>
<p>Secondly, what horses there are in Nejd, are bred in the
Nef&ucirc;ds.&nbsp; The stony plateaux of the interior contain no
suitable pasture except in a very few places, while the
Nef&ucirc;ds afford grass, green or dry, the whole year
round.&nbsp; The Muteyr, the Beni Khaled, the Dafir, and the
Shammar, are now the principal breeders of horses in Nejd, but
the &Aacute;nazeh are regarded as possessing the best strains,
and the &Aacute;nazeh have disappeared from Nejd.&nbsp; They
began to migrate northwards about two hundred years ago, and have
ever since continued moving by successive migrations till all
have abandoned their original homes.&nbsp; It may be that the
great name which Nejd horses undoubtedly have in the East, was
due mainly to these very &Aacute;nazeh, with whose horses they
are now contrasted.&nbsp; The Bisshr &Aacute;nazeh were settled
in the neighbourhood of Kheybar, on the western edge of the
Nef&ucirc;d, the Roala south of J&ocirc;f, and the Amarrat in the
extreme east.&nbsp; These probably among them supplied Nejd
horses in former times to Syria, Bagdad, and Persia, and some
sections of the tribe may even have found their way further
south; for the Ibn Saouds themselves are an &Aacute;nazeh
family.&nbsp; So that then, probably, as now, the best strains of
blood were <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>in their hands.&nbsp; To the present day in the north
the &Aacute;nazeh distinguish the descendants of the mares
brought with them from Nejd as &ldquo;Nejdi,&rdquo; while they
call the descendants of the mares captured from the tribes of the
North, &ldquo;Shimali&rdquo; or Northerners.</p>
<p>The management and education of horses seems to differ little
in Nejd from what it is elsewhere among the Arabs.&nbsp; But we
were surprised to find that, in place of the Bedouin halter, the
bit is used at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; At first we fancied that this was
in imitation of Turkish manners; but it is more likely to be an
old custom with town Arabs.&nbsp; Indeed the Bedouins of the
Sahara, no less than the Turks, use the ring bit, which may after
all have been an invention of Arabia.&nbsp; Bad as it is for the
mouth, it is certainly of use in the fancy riding indulged in at
Ha&iuml;l, the jerid play and sham fighting.&nbsp; Among the
Bedouins of Nejd the halter alone is used.</p>
<p>Of anything like racing we could learn nothing.&nbsp; Trials
of speed are no longer in fashion, as they must have been once,
and skill in turning and doubling is alone of any value.&nbsp;
That some tradition, however, of training still exists among the
Arabs, the following recipe for rearing a colt seems to
prove.&nbsp; It was given us in answer to our description of
English racing and racehorses, and probably represents a
traditional practice of Arabia as old as the days of Mahomet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>ARAB RECIPE FOR REARING A COLT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said our informant, &ldquo;you would make a
colt run faster than his fellows, remember the following
rules:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;During the first month of his life let him be
content with his mother&rsquo;s milk, it will be sufficient for
him.&nbsp; Then during five months add to this natural supply
goat&rsquo;s milk, as much as he will drink.&nbsp; For six months
more give him the milk of camels, and besides a measure of wheat
steeped in water for a quarter of an hour, and served in a
nosebag.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p16.jpg">
<img alt=
"Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s Mares"
title=
"Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s Mares"
src="images/p16.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At a year old the colt will have done with milk;
he must be fed on wheat and grass, the wheat dry from a nose-bag,
the grass green if there is any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At two years old he must work, or he will be
worthless.&nbsp; Feed him now, like a full-grown horse, on
barley; but in summer let him also have gruel daily at
midday.&nbsp; Make the gruel thus:&mdash;Take a double-handful of
flour, and mix it in water well with your hands till the water
seems like milk; then strain it, leaving the dregs of the flour,
and give what is liquid to the colt to drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be careful from the hour he is born to let him
stand in the sun; shade hurts horses, but let him have water in
plenty when the day is hot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The colt must now be mounted, and taken by his
owner everywhere with him, so that he shall see <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>everything,
and learn courage.&nbsp; He must be kept constantly in exercise,
and never remain long at his manger.&nbsp; He should be taken on
a journey, for work will fortify his limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At three years old he should be trained to
gallop.&nbsp; Then, if he be of true blood, he will not be left
behind.&nbsp; Yalla!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

Emir&mdash;The mountain fortress of Agde&mdash;Farewell to
Ha&iuml;l&mdash;We join the Persian Haj&mdash;Ways and manners of
the pilgrims&mdash;A clergyman of Medina.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> hinted at a mystification in
which we found ourselves involved a few days after our arrival at
Ha&iuml;l, and which at the time caused us no little
anxiety.&nbsp; It had its origin in a piece of childishness on
Mohammed&rsquo;s part, whose head was completely turned by the
handsome reception given him as an Ibn Ar&ucirc;k by the Emir,
and a little too, I fear, by our own spoiling.&nbsp; To the
present day I am not quite sure that we heard all that happened,
and so forbear entering upon the matter in detail; but as far as
we could learn, Mohammed&rsquo;s vanity seems to have led him to
aggrandise his own position in the eyes of Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s
court, by representing us as persons whom he had taken under his
protection, and who were in <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>some way dependent on him; boasting
that the camels, horses, and other property were his own, and our
servants his people.&nbsp; This under ordinary circumstances
might have been a matter of small consequence, and we should not
have grudged him a little self-glorification at our expense,
conscious as we were of having owed the success of our journey
hitherto, mainly to his fidelity.&nbsp; But unfortunately the
secondary <i>r&ocirc;le</i> which he would thus have assigned to
us, made our relations with the Emir not only embarrassing, but
positively dangerous.&nbsp; Our reception at first had been
cordial to a degree that made it all the more annoying to find,
that when we had been four days at Ha&iuml;l, we no longer
received the attentions which had hitherto been paid us.&nbsp;
The presents of game ceased, and the lamb, with which we had
hitherto been regaled at dinner, was replaced by camel
meat.&nbsp; Instead of two soldiers being sent to escort us to
the palace, a slave boy came with a message.&nbsp; On the fifth
day we were not invited to the evening party, and on the sixth
Wilfrid, calling at the palace, was told curtly that the Emir was
not at home.&nbsp; We could not imagine the cause of this change,
and Mohammed, usually so cheerful and so open-hearted, had become
moody and embarrassed, keeping almost entirely with the servants
in the outer house.&nbsp; Hanna, the faithful Hanna, began to
hint darkly that things were not well, and Abdallah and the rest
of the Mussulman servants seemed unwilling to do their
duty.&nbsp; We remembered <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>that we were among Wahhabi fanatics,
and we began to be very much alarmed.&nbsp; Still we were far
from guessing the real reason, and it was not till we had been a
week at Ha&iuml;l that Wilfrid, happening to meet the
Emir&rsquo;s chief slave Mubarek, learned from him how matters
stood.&nbsp; It was no use being angry; indeed Mohammed&rsquo;s
conduct was rather childish than disloyal, and the
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> would have not been worth mentioning
except as an illustration of Arab manners and ways of thought,
and also as explaining why our stay at Ha&iuml;l was cut shorter
than we had originally intended it to be; and why, instead of
going on to Kasim, we joined the Persian pilgrimage on their
homeward road to Meshhed Ali.</p>
<p>Matters of course could not rest there, and on returning home
from his interview with Mubarek, Wilfrid upbraided Mohammed with
his folly, and then sent to the palace for Mufurraj, the master
of ceremonies, and the same dignified old gentleman who had
received us on our arrival, and having explained the
circumstances bade him in his turn explain them to the
Emir.&nbsp; The old man promised to do this, and I have no doubt
kept his word, for that very evening we were sent for once more
to the palace, and received with the old cordiality.&nbsp; It is,
too, I think very creditable to the arrangements of the Ha&iuml;l
court, that no explanations of any sort were entered into.&nbsp;
Mohammed, though put in his proper place, was still politely
received; and only an increase of <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>amiable attentions made us remember
that we had ever had cause to complain.&nbsp; As to Mohammed, I
am bound to say, that once the fumes of his vanity evaporated, he
bore no kind of malice for what we had been obliged to do, and
became once more the amiable, attentive and serviceable friend he
had hitherto been.&nbsp; Ill-temper is not an Arab failing.&nbsp;
Still the incident was a lesson and a warning, a lesson that we
were Europeans still among Asiatics, a warning that Ha&iuml;l was
a lion&rsquo;s den, though fortunately we were friends with the
lion.&nbsp; We began to make our plans for moving on.</p>
<p>I have said little as yet about the Persian pilgrimage which,
encamped just outside the walls of Ha&iuml;l, had all along been
a main feature in the goings on of the place.&nbsp; On a certain
Tuesday, however, the Emir sent us a message that he expected us
to come out riding with him, and that he would meet us at that
gate of the town where the pilgrims were.&nbsp; It was a
fortunate day for us, not indeed because we saw the pilgrims, but
because we saw what we would have come the whole journey to see,
and had almost despaired of seeing,&mdash;all the best of the
Emir&rsquo;s horses out and galloping about.&nbsp; We were
delighted at the opportunity, and made haste to get ready.&nbsp;
In half an hour we were on our mares, and in the street.&nbsp;
There was a great concourse of people all moving towards the
camp, and just outside the town we found the Emir&rsquo;s
cavalcade.&nbsp; This for the moment absorbed all my thoughts,
for I had not yet seen <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>any of the Ha&iuml;l horses
mounted.&nbsp; The Emir, splendidly dressed but barefooted, was
riding a pretty little white mare, while the chestnut Krushieh
followed him mounted by a slave.</p>
<p>All our friends were there, Ham&uacute;d, Majid and the two
boys his brothers, with a still smaller boy, whom they introduced
to us as a son of Metaab, the late Emir, all in high spirits and
anxious to show off their horses and their horsemanship; while
next the Emir and under his special protection rode the youth
with the tragical history, Na&iuml;f, the sole remaining son of
Tell&aacute;l, whose brothers Mohammed had killed, and who, it is
whispered, will some day be called on to revenge their
deaths.&nbsp; Mubarek too, the white slave, was there, a slave in
name only, for he is strikingly like the princely family in
feature and is one of the richest and most important personages
in Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; The rest of the party consisted of friends
and servants, with a fair sprinkling of black faces among them,
dressed in their best clothes and mounted on the Emir&rsquo;s
mares.&nbsp; Conspicuous on his beautiful bay was Ham&uacute;d,
who, as usual, did us the honours, and pointed out and explained
the various persons and things we saw.&nbsp; It was one of those
mornings one only finds in Nejd.&nbsp; The air brilliant and
sparkling to a degree one cannot imagine in Europe, and filling
one with a sense of life such as one remembers to have had in
childhood, and which gives one a wish to shout.&nbsp; The sky of
an intense blue, and the <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>hills in front of us carved out of
sapphire, and the plain, crisp and even as a billiard table,
sloping gently upwards towards them.&nbsp; On one side the
battlemented walls and towers of Ha&iuml;l, with the palace
rising out of a dark mass of palms almost black in the sunlight;
on the other the pilgrim camp, a parti-coloured mass of tents,
blue, green, red, white, with the pilgrims themselves in a dark
crowd, watching with curious half-frightened eyes the barbaric
display of which we formed a part.</p>
<p>Presently the Emir gave a signal to advance, and turning
towards the south-west, our whole party moved on in the direction
of a clump of palm-trees we could see about two miles off.&nbsp;
Ham&uacute;d then suddenly put his mare into a gallop, and one
after another the rest of the party joined him in a sham fight,
galloping, doubling, and returning to the Emir, who remained
alone with us, and shouting as though they would bring the sky
about their ears.&nbsp; At last the Emir could resist it no
longer, and seizing a jerid or palm stick from one of the slaves,
went off himself among the others.&nbsp; In a moment his dignity
and his town manners were forgotten, and he became the Bedouin
again which he and all his family really are.&nbsp; His silk
kefiyehs were thrown back, and bare-headed with his long Bedouin
plaits streaming in the wind and bare-legged and bare-armed, he
galloped hither and thither; charging into the throng, and
pursuing and being pursued, <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and shouting as if he had never felt
a care, and never committed a crime in his life.</p>
<p>We found ourselves alone with a strange little personage whom
we had already noticed riding beside the Emir, and who seemed
even more out of place in this fantastic entertainment than
ourselves.&nbsp; I hope at least that we looked less ridiculous
than he did.&nbsp; Mounted on a sorry little kadish, and dressed
in the fashion of European children fifty years ago, with a high
waisted coat, well pleated at the skirt, trousers up to his
knees, and feet shod with slippers, a little brown skull cap on
his head, and a round shaven face, sat what seemed an overgrown
boy, but what in reality was a chief person from among the
Persian pilgrims.&nbsp; It was Ali Koli Khan, son of the great
Khan of the Bactiari, who for his father&rsquo;s sake was being
treated by the Emir with all possible honour.&nbsp; He, with the
rest of the Haj, was now on his way back from Mecca, and it was
partly to impress him with the Emir&rsquo;s magnificence that the
present party had been arranged.</p>
<p>We did not long stay alone, for in a few minutes the galloping
ceased, and we then went on sedately as before, and in due time
arrived at the palm trees, which, it turned out, were the
Emir&rsquo;s property, and contained in a garden surrounded by a
high wall.&nbsp; Here we were invited to dismount, and a carpet
having been spread under the trees, we all sat down.&nbsp; Slaves
were soon busy serving a luncheon of sweetmeats,&mdash;boys were
made to climb the lemon trees, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and shake down the fruit, and coffee
was handed round.&nbsp; Then all the party said their prayers
except ourselves and the Persian, who, as a Shiah, could not join
in their devotions, and we mounted again and rode home.&nbsp;
This time we too joined in the galloping, which speedily
recommenced, our mares fully enjoying the fun, and in this way we
scampered back to Ha&iuml;l.</p>
<p>On the following day Wilfrid called on Ali Koli Khan in his
tent, going there with Mohammed, now once more a reasonable
companion and follower.&nbsp; Indeed in the Persian camp
assumptions of nobility on Mohammed&rsquo;s part would have been
quite thrown away, for the Persians care nothing for Arabian
nobility, and treat all alike as Bedouins and barbarians.&nbsp;
Ali Koli, though only a younger son, was travelling in state,
having his mother with him, and a multitude of servants, male and
female, besides his <i>hemeldaria</i> or contractor, and the
Arabs managing his beasts.&nbsp; His major-domo and interpreter
was a magnificent personage, and his followers, dressed in felt
tunics and skull caps, gave him the appearance of being an
important chief.&nbsp; His tent was of the Turkish pattern, well
lined and comfortable, with fine Persian carpets on the floor,
and a divan.&nbsp; There Wilfrid found him sitting with a friend,
Abd er-Rahim, the son of a merchant of Kermanshah, who is also
British consular agent there.&nbsp; The young Persians were very
amiable; but the contrast of their manners with those of the
ceremonious Arabs <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>struck Wilfrid at once.&nbsp; There were none of those
elaborate compliments and polite inquiries one gets used to at
Ha&iuml;l, but rather a European <i>sans g&eacute;ne</i> in the
form of reception.&nbsp; They made Wilfrid comfortable on the
divan, called for tea, which was served in a <i>samovar</i>, and
at once poured out a long history of their sufferings on the
pilgrimage.&nbsp; This they did in very broken Arabic, and with
an accent irresistibly absurd, for the Persians speak with a
drawl in their intonation, wholly foreign to that of the
Arabs.&nbsp; Ali&rsquo;s natural language, he says, is Kurdish,
but being an educated person, and an officer in the Shah&rsquo;s
army, he talks Persian equally well.&nbsp; In Persia, Arabic
plays much the part in education which Latin did in Europe before
it was quite a dead language.&nbsp; Both he and Abd er-Rahim were
loud in complaints of every thing Arabian, and in spite of
Mohammed&rsquo;s presence, abused roundly the whole Arab race,
the poverty of the towns, the ignorance of the citizens, and the
robberies of the Bedouins, also the extortionate charges of the
Arab hemeldarias, contractors for camels, and the miseries of
desert travelling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was ever anything seen so
miserable as the bazaar at Ha&iuml;l; not a bag of sweetmeats to
be had for love or money, the Arabs were mere barbarians,
drinkers of coffee instead of tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every now and
then, too, they would break out into conversation in their own
language.&nbsp; Wilfrid, however, liked Ali Koli, and they parted
very good friends, with an invitation from both the young <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Persians to
travel on with them to Meshhed on the Euphrates, where the
Persians always end their pilgrimage by a visit to the shrines of
Ali and Huseyn.&nbsp; This seemed an excellent opportunity, and
having consulted the Emir, who highly approved of the plan, we
accordingly decided to travel with the Haj as soon as it should
start.</p>
<p>Our last days at Ha&iuml;l were by no means the least
pleasant.&nbsp; As a final proof of his goodwill and confidence,
the Emir announced that we might pay a visit to Agde, a fortress
in the mountains some miles from Ha&iuml;l, and which he had
never before shown to any stranger.&nbsp; I do not feel at
liberty to say exactly where this is, for we were sent to see it
rather on parole, and though I hope Ibn Rashid runs no danger of
foreign invasion, I would not give a clue to possible
enemies.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that it lies in the mountains,
in a position of great natural strength, made stronger by some
rude attempts at fortification, and that it is really one of the
most curious places in the world.</p>
<p>One approaches it from the plain by a narrow winding valley,
reminding one not a little of the wadys of Mount Sinai, where the
granite rocks rise abruptly on either hand out of a pure bed of
sand.&nbsp; On one of these is engraved an inscription in Arabic
which we copied and which though not very legible may be read
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Hadihi
khar&acirc;bat Senh&acirc;rib.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;This (is) the ruin of
Senacherib (&rsquo;s building).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Such at
least is its meaning in the opinion of Mr. Sabunji, a competent
Arabic scholar, though I will not venture to explain on what
occasion Senacherib made his way to Nejd, nor why he wrote in
Arabic instead of his own cuneiform.</p>
<p>Inside the defences, the valley broadens out into an
amphitheatre formed by the junction of three or four wadys in
which there is a village and a palm garden.&nbsp; Besides which,
the wadys are filled with wild palms watered, the Arabs say,
&ldquo;min Allah,&rdquo; by Providence, at least by no human
hand.&nbsp; They are very beautiful, forming a brilliant contrast
of green fertility with the naked granite crags which overhang
them on all sides.&nbsp; These are perhaps a thousand feet in
height, and run down sheer into the sandy floor of the wadys, so
that one is reminded in looking at them of that valley of
diamonds where the serpents lived, and down which the merchants
threw their pieces of meat for the rocs to gather, in the tale of
Sinbad the Sailor.&nbsp; No serpents however live in Agde, but a
population of very honest Shammar, who entertained us with a
prodigality of dates and coffee, difficult to do justice
to.&nbsp; We had been sent in the company of two horsemen of the
Emir&rsquo;s, Shammar, who did the honours, as Agde and all in it
are really Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s private property.&nbsp; These and
the villagers gave us a deal of information about the hills we
were in, and showed us where a great battle had been fought by
Mohammed&rsquo;s father and his uncle Obeyd against <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the Ibn Ali,
formerly Emirs of the Jebel.&nbsp; It would seem that Agde was
the oldest possession of the Ibn Rashids, and that on their
taking Ha&iuml;l the Ibn Alis marched against them, when they
retreated to their fortress, and there gave battle and such a
defeat to the people of Kefar that it secured to the Ibn Rashids
supreme power ever after.&nbsp; They also showed us with great
pride a wall built by Obeyd to block the narrow valley, and made
us look at everything, wells, gardens, and houses, so that we
spent nearly all the day there.&nbsp; They told us too of a
mysterious beast that comes from the hills by night and climbs
the palm trees for sake of the dates.&nbsp; &ldquo;As large as a
hare, with a long tail, and very good to eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
describe it as sitting on its hind-legs, and whistling, so that
Wilfrid thinks it must be a marmot.&nbsp; Only, do marmots
climb?&nbsp; They call it the Webber.</p>
<p>We had a delightful gallop home with the two Bedouins,
(Mohammed was not with us,) of whom we learned one of the Shammar
war songs, which runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ma arid ana erkobu del&uacute;l,<br />
Lau zeynuli shedadeha,<br />
Aridu ana hamra shen&ucirc;f,<br />
Hamra seryeh aruddeha.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>thus literally translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I would not ride a mere del&uacute;l,<br />
Though lovely to me her shedad (camel-saddle);<br />
Let me be mounted on a mare,<br />
A bay mare, swift and quick to turn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>They
were mounted on very pretty ponies, but could not keep up with us
galloping.&nbsp; If we had been in Turkey, or indeed anywhere
else but in Arabia, we should have had to give a handsome tip
after an expedition of this kind; but at Ha&iuml;l nothing of the
sort was expected.&nbsp; Both these Shammar were exceedingly
intelligent well mannered men, with souls above money.&nbsp; They
were doing their duty to the prince as Sheykh, and to us as
strangers, and they did it enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The level of Agde is 3,780 feet above the sea, that of
Ha&iuml;l 3,500.</p>
<p>This was, perhaps, the pleasantest day of all those we spent
at Ha&iuml;l, and will live long with us as a delightful
remembrance.&nbsp; On the following day we were to depart.&nbsp;
Mohammed, while we were away, had been making preparations.&nbsp;
Two new camels had been bought, and a month&rsquo;s provision of
dates and rice purchased, in addition to a gift of excellent
Yemen coffee sent us by the Emir.&nbsp; Our last interview with
Ibn Rashid was characteristic.&nbsp; He was not at the kasr, but
in a house he has close to the Mecca gate, where from a little
window he can watch unperceived the goings on of the Haj encamped
below him.&nbsp; We found him all alone, for he has lost all fear
of our being assassins now, at his window like a bird of prey,
calculating no doubt how many more silver pieces he should be
able to make out of the Persians before they were well out of his
clutches.&nbsp; Every now and then he <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>would lean out of the window, which
was partly covered by a shutter, and shout to one of his men who
were standing below some message with regard to the
pilgrims.&nbsp; He seemed to be enjoying the pleasure of his
power over them, and it is absolute.</p>
<p>To us he was very amiable, renewing all his protestations of
friendship and regard, and offering to give us anything we might
choose to ask for, dromedaries for the journey, or one of his
mares.&nbsp; This, although we should have liked to accept the
last offer, we of course declined, Wilfrid making a short speech
in the Arab manner, saying that the only thing we asked was the
Emir&rsquo;s regard, and wishing him length of days.&nbsp; He
begged Mohammed ibn Rashid to consider him as his vakil in Europe
in case he required assistance of any kind, and thanked him for
all the kindness we had received at his hands.&nbsp; The Emir
then proposed that we should put off our departure, and go with
him instead on a ghaz&uacute; or warlike expedition he was
starting on in a few days, a very attractive offer which might
have been difficult to refuse had it been made earlier, but which
we now declined.&nbsp; Our heads, in fact, had been in the jaws
of the lion long enough, and now our only object was to get
quietly and decorously out of the den.&nbsp; We therefore pleaded
want of time, and added that our camels were already on the road;
we then said good-bye and took our leave.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>There
was, however, one more visit to be paid, this time of friendly
regard more than of ceremony.&nbsp; As we rode through the town
we stopped at Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s house and found him and all
his family at home.&nbsp; To them our farewells were really
expressions of regret at parting, and Ham&uacute;d gave us some
very sound advice about going on with the Haj to Meshhed Ali,
instead of trying to get across to Bussora.&nbsp; There had been
rain, he said, on the pilgrim road, and all the reservoirs (those
marked on the map as the tanks of Zobeydeh) were full, so that
our journey that way would be exceptionally easy, whereas between
this and Bussorah, we should have to pass over an almost
waterless region, without anything interesting to compensate for
the difficulty.&nbsp; But this we should see as we went
on&mdash;the first thing, as I have said, was to get clear away,
and it would be time enough later to settle details about our
course.</p>
<p>Majid was there, and received from Wilfrid as a remembrance a
silver-handled Spanish knife, whereupon he sent for a black cloth
cloak with a little gold embroidery on the collar and presented
it to me.&nbsp; It was a suitable gift, for I had nothing of the
sort, indeed no respectable abba at all, and this one was both
dignified and quiet in appearance.&nbsp; Majid at least, I am
sure, regrets us, and if circumstances ever take us again to
Ha&iuml;l, it would be the best fortune for us to find him or his
father on the throne.&nbsp; They are regarded as the natural
heirs to <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>the Sheykhat, and Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s does not look like
a long life.</p>
<p>After this we mounted, and in another five minutes were clear
of the town.&nbsp; Then looking back, we each drew a long breath,
for Ha&iuml;l with all the charm of its strangeness, and its
interesting inhabitants, had come to be like a prison to us, and
at one time when we had had that quarrel with Mohammed, had
seemed very like a tomb.</p>
<p>We left Ha&iuml;l by the same gate at which we had entered it,
what seemed like years before, but instead of turning towards the
mountains, we skirted the wall of the town and further on the
palm gardens, which are its continuation, for about three miles
down a ravine-like wady.&nbsp; Then we came out on the plain
again, and at the last isolated group of ithel trees, halted for
the last time to enjoy the shade, for the sun was almost hot,
before joining the pilgrim caravan, which we could see like a
long line of ants traversing the plain between us and the main
range of Jebel Shammar.</p>
<p>It was, without exception, the most beautiful view I ever saw
in my life, and I will try to describe it.&nbsp; To begin with,
it must be understood that the air, always clear in Jebel
Shammar, was this day of a transparent clearness, which probably
surpasses anything seen in ordinary deserts, or in the high
regions of the Alps, or at the North Pole, or anywhere except
perhaps in the moon.&nbsp; For this is the very centre of the
desert, four <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>hundred miles from the sea, and nearly four thousand
feet above the sea level.&nbsp; Before us lay a foreground of
coarse reddish sand, the washing down of the granite rocks of
Jebel Aja, with here and there magnificent clumps of ithel, great
pollards whose trunks measure twenty and thirty feet <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a> in circumference, growing on little
mounds showing where houses once stood&mdash;just as in Sussex
the yew trees do&mdash;for the town seems to have shifted from
this end of the oasis to where it now is.&nbsp; Across this sand
lay a long green belt of barley, perhaps a couple of acres in
extent, the blades of corn brilliantly green, and just having
shot up high enough to hide the irrigation furrows.&nbsp; Beyond
this, for a mile or more, the level desert fading from red to
orange, till it was again cut by what appeared to be a shining
sheet of water reflecting the deep blue of the sky&mdash;a mirage
of course, but the most perfect illusion that can be
imagined.&nbsp; Crossing this, and apparently wading in the
water, was the long line of the pilgrim camels, each reflected
exactly in the mirage below him with the dots of blue, red,
green, or pink, representing the litter or tent he carried.&nbsp;
The line of the procession might be five miles or more in length;
we could not see the end of it.&nbsp; Beyond again rose the
confused fantastic mass of the sapphire coloured crags of Jebel
Aja, the most strange and beautiful <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>mountain range that can be
imagined&mdash;a lovely vision.</p>
<p>When we had sufficiently admired all this, and I had made my
sketch of it, for there was no hurry, we got on our mares again
and rejoicing with them in our freedom, galloped on singing the
Shammar song, &ldquo;Ma arid ana erkobu del&uacute;l lau zeynoli
shedadeha, biddi ana hamra shen&ucirc;f, hamra seriyeh
arruddeha,&rdquo; a proceeding which inspired them more than any
whip or spur could have done, and which as we converged towards
the Haj caravan, made the camels caper, and startled the pilgrims
into the idea that the Harb Bedouins were once more upon
them.&nbsp; So we went along with Mohammed following us, till we
reached the vanguard of the Haj, and the green and red banner
which goes in front of it.&nbsp; Close to this we found our own
camels, and soon after camped with them, not ten miles from
Ha&iuml;l in a bit of a wady where the standard was planted.</p>
<p>Our tents are a couple of hundred yards away from the Haj
camp, which is crowded together for fear of the dangers of the
desert.&nbsp; The pilgrim mueddins have just chanted the evening
call to prayers, and the people are at their devotions.&nbsp; Our
mares are munching their barley, and our hawk (a trained bird we
bought yesterday for six mejidies of a Bedouin at Ha&iuml;l), is
sitting looking very wise on his perch in front of us.&nbsp; It
is a cold evening, but oh how clean and comfortable in the
tent!</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span><i>February</i> 2.&mdash;It appears after all that only
about half the Haj left Ha&iuml;l yesterday.&nbsp; There has been
a difficulty about camels some say, others that Ibn Rashid will
not let the people go, an affair of money probably in either
case.&nbsp; So we had hardly gone more than two miles before a
halt was ordered by the emir el-haj, one Ambar, a black slave of
Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s, and the camels and their riders remained
massed together on a piece of rising ground for the purpose we
think of being counted.&nbsp; The dervishes, however, and other
pilgrims on foot went on as they liked, and so did we, for we do
not consider ourselves bound by any of the rules of the Haj
procession, and Abdallah has orders to march our camels well
outside the main body.&nbsp; There was no road or track at all
to-day, and we went forward on the look-out for water which we
heard was somewhere on ahead, crossing some very rough ground and
wadys which were almost ravines.&nbsp; We have become so used to
the desert now, that from a long distance we made out the water,
guessing its position from the white colour of the ground near
it.&nbsp; The whiteness is caused by a stonelike deposit the
water makes when it stands long anywhere; and in this instance it
lay in a sort of natural reservoir or series of reservoirs in the
bed of a shallow wady.&nbsp; These must have been filled some
time during the winter by rain, and we hurried on to fill our
goat skins at them while they were still clean, for the pilgrims
would soon drink up and <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>pollute them.&nbsp; They are but
small pools.&nbsp; We found Awwad already there, he having been
sent on in front with a del&uacute;l to make sure of our supply,
and the process of filling the skins was hardly over before the
dervishes who always march ahead of the Haj began to
arrive.&nbsp; They have an unpleasant habit of washing in the
water first, and drinking it afterwards, which we are told is
part of their religious ritual.</p>
<p>The wind has been very violent all day with a good deal of
sand in it, but it has now gone down.&nbsp; Our course since
leaving Ha&iuml;l has been east by north, and is directed towards
a tall hill, Jebel Jildiyeh, which is a very conspicuous
landmark.&nbsp; Our camp to-night is a pleasanter one than
yesterday&rsquo;s, being further from the pilgrims, and we have a
little wady all to ourselves, with plenty of good firewood, and
food for the camels.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 3.&mdash;Though fires were lit this morning at
four o&rsquo;clock as if in preparation of an early start, no
move has been made to-day.&nbsp; Half the pilgrimage they tell us
is still at Ha&iuml;l, and must be waited for.&nbsp; Wilfrid went
to-day into the camp to find our friend Ali Koli Khan, but
neither he nor Abd er-Rahim, nor anyone else he knew had
arrived.</p>
<p>The Persian pilgrims, though not very agreeable in person or
in habits (for they are without the sense of propriety which is
so characteristic of the Arabs), are friendly enough, and if we
could talk to them, would, I dare say, be interesting, but on a
superficial <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>comparison with the Arabs they seem coarse and
boorish.&nbsp; They are most of them fair complexioned, and many
have fair hair and blue eyes; but their features are heavy, and
there is much the same difference between them and the Shammar
who are escorting them, as there is between a Dutch cart-horse
and one of Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s mares.&nbsp; In spite of their
washings, which are performed in season and out of season all day
long, they look unutterably dirty in their greasy felt dresses,
as no unwashed Arab ever did.&nbsp; Awwad and the rest of our
people now and then get into disputes with them when they come
too near our tents in search of firewood, and it is evident that
there is no love lost between Persian and Arab.</p>
<p>My day has been spent profitably at home re-stuffing my
saddle, which was sadly in want of it.&nbsp; Mohammed has become
quite himself again, no airs or graces of any kind, and, as he
says, the air of Ha&iuml;l did not agree with him.&nbsp; He seems
anxious now to efface all recollection of the past, and has made
himself very agreeable, telling us histories connected with the
Sebaa and their horses, all of them instructive, some
amusing.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 4.&mdash;Another day&rsquo;s waiting, the
pilgrims as well as we ourselves impatient, but impatience is no
good.&nbsp; Wilfrid, by way of occupying the time, went off on a
surveying expedition by himself, with his mare and the
greyhounds.&nbsp; He went in a straight line northwards, towards
a line of low hills which <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>are visible here from the high
ground.&nbsp; They are about twelve miles off.&nbsp; He met
nobody except a couple of Bedouins on del&uacute;ls, going to
Atwa, where they told him there is a well.&nbsp; They looked on
him and his gun with suspicion, and did not much like being
cross-questioned.&nbsp; After that he found the desert absolutely
empty of life, a succession of level sandy plains, and rough
ridges of sandstone.&nbsp; The hills themselves, which he reached
before turning back, were also of yellow sandstone, weathered
black in patches, and from the top of the ridge he could make out
the Nef&ucirc;d, like a red sea.&nbsp; He galloped to the ridge
and back in three hours.&nbsp; The ride was useful, as it enabled
him to get the position of several of the principal hills,
Yatubb, Jildiyeh, and others, and to mark them on his
chart.&nbsp; He did not say where he intended to go, but as it
happened, he returned before there was time for me to become
anxious.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Awwad and Abdallah had been giving the
falcon a lesson with a lure they have made out of one of the
nosebags.&nbsp; The bird seems very tame, and comes to Awwad when
he calls it, shouting &ldquo;Ash&rsquo;o, ash&rsquo;o,&rdquo;
which he explains is the short for its name, Rasham, a corruption
of the word <i>rashmon</i>, which means shining like
lightning.&nbsp; We may hope now with Rasham&rsquo;s assistance
to keep ourselves supplied with meat, for hares are in
plenty.</p>
<p>In the afternoon visitors came, some Shammar Bedouins of the
Ibn Duala family, who have <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>preferred to camp beside us, as more
congenial neighbours to them than the Persians.&nbsp; They are on
their way from Ha&iuml;l to their tents in the Nef&ucirc;d with a
message from the Emir that more camels are wanted; and they are
going on afterwards with the Haj as far as Meshhed Ali, or
perhaps to Samawa on the Euphrates, to buy rice (tummin), and
wheat.&nbsp; It is only twice a year that the tribes of Jebel
Shammar can communicate with the outside world; on the occasion
of the two Haj journeys, coming and going.&nbsp; It is then that
they lay in their provision for the year.&nbsp; The eldest of
these Ibn Duala, a man of sixty, is very well-mannered and
amiable.&nbsp; He dined with Mohammed and the servants in their
tent, and came to sit with us afterwards in ours.&nbsp; We are in
half a mind to leave this dawdling Haj, and go on with him
to-morrow.&nbsp; But his tents lie some way to the left out of
our road.</p>
<p>Besides the Ibn Dualas, there are some poor Bedouins with
their camels crouched down in our wady to be out of sight.&nbsp;
They are afraid of being impressed for the Haj, and at first it
was difficult to understand why, if so, they should have come so
close to it.&nbsp; But they explained that they hoped to get lost
in the crowd, and hoped to have the advantage of its company,
without having their camels loaded.&nbsp; They, like everybody
else, are on their way to Meshhed to buy corn.</p>
<p>There is a report that the Emir is coming from Ha&iuml;l
to-morrow, and will travel three days with the <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>pilgrimage,
going on afterwards, nobody knows where, on a ghaz&uacute;.&nbsp;
This would be tiresome, as now we have wished him good-bye we
only want to get away.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 5.&mdash;We have moved at last, but only
another ten miles, to a larger wady, which seems to drain the
whole country, and which they call Wady Hanasser (the valley of
the little fingers), why so called I cannot say.&nbsp; Here there
are numerous wells, and a large tract of camel pasture, of the
sort called <i>rimh</i>.&nbsp; There are a good number of hares
in this cover, and we have had some coursing with our greyhounds,
aided by a sort of lurcher who has attached himself to us.&nbsp;
The servants call him &ldquo;Merzug,&rdquo; which may be
translated a &ldquo;windfall&rdquo; literally a gift from God, an
unattractive animal, but possessed of a nose.</p>
<p>Two hours after starting we came to a curious tell standing
quite alone in the plain.&nbsp; It is, like all the rest of the
country now, of sandstone, and we were delighted to find it
covered with inscriptions, <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and pictures
of birds and beasts of the sort we had already seen, but much
better executed, and on a larger scale.&nbsp; The character,
whatever its name, is a very handsome one, as distinct and
symmetrical as the Greek or Latin capitals, and some of the
drawings have a rude, but real artistic merit.&nbsp; They cannot
be the work of mere barbarians, any more than the alphabet.&nbsp;
It is remarkable that all the animals represented are essentially
Arabian, the gazelle, the camel, the ibex, the ostrich.&nbsp; I
noticed also a palm tree conventionally treated, but nothing like
a house, or even a tent.&nbsp; The principal subject is a
composition of two camels with necks crossed, of no small
merit.&nbsp; It is combined with an inscription very regularly
cut.&nbsp; That these things are very ancient is proved by the
colour of the indentations.&nbsp; The rock is a reddish sandstone
weathered black, and it is evident that when fresh, the letters
and drawings stood out red against a dark back-ground, but now
many of these have been completely weathered over again, a
process it must have taken centuries in this dry climate to
effect.</p>
<p>We were in front of the Haj when we came to this tell (Tell es
Sayliyeh), and we waited on the top of it while the whole
procession passed us, an hour or more.&nbsp; It was a curious
spectacle.&nbsp; From the height where we were, we could see for
thirty or forty miles back over the plain, as far as Jebel Aja,
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>at the
foot of which Ha&iuml;l lies.&nbsp; The procession, three miles
long, was composed of some four thousand camels (nor was this the
whole Haj), with a great number of men on foot besides.&nbsp; In
front were the dervishes, walking very fast, almost running; wild
dirty people, but amiable, and quite ready to converse if they
know Arabic; then, a group of respectably dressed people walking
out of piety, a man with an immense blue turban, we believe to be
an Afghan; a slim, very neat-looking youth, who might be a clerk
or a shopkeeper&rsquo;s assistant, reading as he walks a scroll,
and others carrying leather bottles in their hands containing
water for their ablutions, which they stop every now and then to
perform.&nbsp; Sometimes they chant or recite prayers.&nbsp; All
these devotees are very rude to us, answering nothing when we
salute them, and being thrown into consternation if the
greyhounds come near them lest they should be touched by them and
defiled.&nbsp; One of them, the youth with the scroll, stopped
this morning at our fire to warm his hands as he went by, and we
offered him a cup of coffee, but he said he had breakfasted, and
turned to talk to the servants, his fellow Mussulmans, but the
servants told him to move on.&nbsp; Among Arabs, to refuse a cup
of coffee is the grossest offence, and is almost tantamount to a
declaration of war.&nbsp; The Arabs do not understand the
religious prejudices of the Shiyite Persians.</p>
<p>Some way behind these forerunners comes the <i>berak</i>, <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>or banner,
carried in the centre of a group of mounted dromedaries
magnificently caparisoned and moving on at a fast walk.&nbsp;
These most beautiful creatures have coats like satin, eyes like
those of the gazelle, and a certain graceful action which baffles
description.&nbsp; Not even the Arabian horse has such a look of
breeding as these thorough-bred camels.&nbsp; They are called
<i>naamiyeh</i>, because one may go to sleep while riding them
without being disturbed by the least jolting.</p>
<p>The berak, Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s standard, is a square of purple
silk with a device and motto in white in the centre, and a green
border.&nbsp; It is carried by a servant on a tall dromedary, and
is usually partly furled on the march.&nbsp; Ambar, the negro
emir el-Haj, generally accompanies this group.&nbsp; He has a
little white mare led by a slave which follows him, and which we
have not yet seen him ride.</p>
<p>After the berak comes the mass of pilgrims, mounted sometimes
two on one camel, sometimes with a couple of boxes on each side,
the household furniture.&nbsp; The camels are the property of
Bedouins, mostly Shammar, but many of them Dafir, Sher&acirc;rat,
or Howeysin.&nbsp; They follow their animals on foot, and are at
perpetual wrangle with the pilgrims, although, if they come to
blows, Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s police mounted on dromedaries
interfere, deciding the quarrel in a summary manner.</p>
<p>A Persian riding on a camel is the most ridiculous sight in
the world.&nbsp; He insists on <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>sitting astride, and seems absolutely
unable to learn the ways and habits of the creature he rides; and
he talks to it with his falsetto voice in a language no Arabian
camel could possibly understand.&nbsp; The jokes cut on the
Persians by the Arabs never cease from morning till night.&nbsp;
The better class of pilgrims, and of course all the women except
the very poor, travel in <i>mahmals</i> or
litters&mdash;panniers, of which a camel carries
two&mdash;covered over like a tradesman&rsquo;s van with blue or
red canvas.&nbsp; One or two persons possess <i>tahteravans</i>,
a more expensive kind of conveyance, which requires two mules or
two camels, one before and one behind, to carry it.&nbsp; In
either of these litters the traveller can squat or even lie down
and sleep.&nbsp; The camels chosen for the mahmals are strong and
even-paced; and some of these double panniers are fitted up with
a certain care and elegance, and the luxuries of Persian rugs and
hangings.&nbsp; A confidential driver leads the camel, and
servants sometimes walk beside it.&nbsp; One of the pilgrims
keeps a man to march in front with his narghileh, which he smokes
through a very long tube sitting in the pannier above.&nbsp;
There are a few horses, perhaps about half a dozen.&nbsp; One, a
white Kehilan Harkan, was bought the other day by a rich pilgrim
from a Shammar Bedouin of the escort.&nbsp; This horse seems to
be thoroughbred as far as can be judged from his head, tail, and
pasterns; the rest of him is hidden by a huge <i>pallan</i>, or
pack-saddle, with trappings, in which his new <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>owner rides
him.&nbsp; I have seen no others worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The whole of this procession defiled before us as we sat
perched on the Tell es Sayliyeh just above their heads.</p>
<p>We have made some new acquaintances, Hejazis from Medina, who
came to our tent to-day and sat down in a friendly way to drink
coffee with us.&nbsp; The Hejazi, though accounted pure Arabs,
are almost as black as negroes, and have mean squat features,
very unlike those of the Shammar and other pure races we have
seen.&nbsp; They are also wanting in dignity, and have a sort of
Gascon reputation in this part of Arabia.&nbsp; These were
extremely outspoken people.&nbsp; The chief man among them, one
Saleh ibn Benji, is keeper of the grand mosque at Medina, and is
now travelling to collect alms in Persia for the shrine.</p>

<p>He told us that although quite willing to make friends with us
here and drink our coffee, he could not advise us to go to
Medina.&nbsp; Not but what Englishmen as Englishmen were in good
repute there; but it was against their rule to allow any except
Mussulmans inside the town.&nbsp; If we came as Mussulmans it
would be all very well, but as Nasrani it would not do.&nbsp; He
himself would be the first to try and compass our deaths.&nbsp;
They had found a Jew in Medina last year and executed him; and
the people were very angry because the Sultan had sent a Frank
engineer to survey the district, and had given out that he was <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>a
Moslem.&nbsp; The rule only applied to the two holy cities, Mecca
and Medina, not to the rest of the country.&nbsp; The Mussulman
subjects of the Queen who came from India were (even though
Shias) always well received; so should we be if we conformed to
Islam.&nbsp; The Persians, though tolerated by the Hejazi, were
disliked as Persians as well as heretics, and often got beaten in
Medina.&nbsp; He (Saleh) was going to collect money from them, as
they were fools enough to give it him, but he did not care for
their company.&nbsp; He would sooner travel with us.&nbsp; We
might all go together on this tour through Persia.&nbsp; One
thing he could not understand about the English Government, and
that was, what earthly interest they had in interfering with the
slave trade.&nbsp; We said it was to prevent cruelty.&nbsp; But
there was no cruelty in it, he insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who ever
saw a negro ill-treated?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; We could not say
that we had ever done so in Arabia; and, indeed, it is notorious
that with the Arabs the slaves are like spoiled children rather
than servants.&nbsp; We had to explain that in other countries
slaves were badly used; but as Saleh remained unconvinced, we
could only wind up with a general remark, that this interference
with the slave trade was a &ldquo;shoghl hukm,&rdquo; a matter
concerning the Government, and no affair of ours.&nbsp; He seemed
pretty well informed of what was going on in the world, having
heard of the Russian war, though not the full circumstances of
its termination; and of the cession of Cyprus, as to <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>which he
remarked, that the English Queen has been given Kubros as a
bakshish by the Sultan.&nbsp; His last words were, &ldquo;Plain
speaking is best.&nbsp; I am your friend here; but, remember, not
in Medina, on account of religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>February</i> 6.&mdash;We are tired of loitering with the
Haj, and besides, do not care to see more of Ibn Rashid, who is
expected to-day.&nbsp; It is always a good rule not to outstay
your welcome, and to go when you have once said good-bye.&nbsp;
So, finding no indication of a move in the pilgrim camp this
morning, we decided on marching without them.&nbsp; We have not
gone far; indeed, from the high ground where we are camped we can
see the smoke of the camp rising up at the edge of the
plain.&nbsp; There is capital pasture here; and we have a fine
wide prospect to the south and west; Jebel Jildiyeh being now due
south of us, and Jebel Aja west by south, Ha&iuml;l perhaps forty
miles off; to the north the Nef&ucirc;d, and behind us to the
east from the ridge above our camp, we can look over a subbkha
six or seven miles distant, with the oasis of Bekaa or Taybetism
(happy be its name) round its shores.&nbsp; The place had always
been called Bekaa, we are told, till a few years ago, when the
name was <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>thought unlucky, and changed, though I cannot quite
understand why, for the word means a place where water can
collect.</p>
<p>We flew our falcon to-day, and, after one or two
disappointments, it caught us a hare.&nbsp; The wadys are full of
hares, but the dogs cannot see them in the high bushes, and this
was the only one started in the open.&nbsp; We have encamped
early, and are enjoying the solitude.&nbsp; The moon will be full
to-night; and it is provoking to think how much of its light has
been wasted by delay.&nbsp; The moon is of little use for
travelling after it is full.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 7.&mdash;Though we did not move our camp
to-day, we had a long ride, and got as far as the village of
Taybetism, which is worth seeing.&nbsp; It is a very curious
place, resembling Jobba as far as situation goes.&nbsp; Indeed,
it seems probable that most of the towns of Nejd have in common
this feature, that they are placed in hollows towards which the
water drains, as it is in such positions that wells can be dug
without much labour.&nbsp; Like Jobba, Taybetism has a subbkha,
but the latter is altogether a more important oasis, for the
palm-gardens reach nearly round the lake, and though not quite
continuous, they must have an extent of four or five miles.&nbsp;
The houses seem to be scattered in groups all along this length,
and there is no special town. <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>The geology
of the district is most interesting.&nbsp; At the edge of the
subbkha the sandstone rocks form strange fantastic cliffs, none
more than fifty feet high, but most fanciful in form.&nbsp; Some,
shaped like mushrooms, show that the subbkha must at one time
have been an important lake, instead of the dry semblance of a
lake it now is.&nbsp; We measured the largest of these, and found
it was forty feet in length by twenty-five in width at top, with
a stalk of only five feet, the whole mass resting on a high
pedestal.&nbsp; Other rocks looked as though they had been
suddenly cooled while boiling and red hot, with the bubbles
petrified as they stood.&nbsp; There were broad sheets of
rose-coloured stone like strawberry cream with more cream poured
into it and not yet mixed, streaked pink and white.&nbsp; Here
and there, there were patches of Nef&ucirc;d sand with the green
Nef&ucirc;d adr growing on them, and clusters of wild palms and
tamarisks with a pool or two of bitter water.&nbsp; The subbkha,
although quite dry, looked like a lake, so perfect was the
mirage, of clear blue water without a ripple, reflecting the
palms and houses on the opposite shore.&nbsp; We went round to
some of these, and found beautiful gardens and well-to-do farms
with patches of green barley growing outside.&nbsp; These were
watered from wells about forty-five feet deep, good water, which
the people drew for our mares to drink.&nbsp; We passed, but did
not go into a large square kasr belonging to Ibn Rashid, where a
dozen or so of dervishes <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>from the Haj were loafing
about.&nbsp; They asked us for news&mdash;whether the Emir had
come, and whether the Haj was still waiting.&nbsp; These were
most of them not Persian dervishes, though Shias, but from Bagdad
and Meshhed Ali, people of Arab race.</p>
<p>On our way back we crossed a party of Shammar Bedouins, with
their camels come for water from the Nef&ucirc;d, which is close
by.&nbsp; They gave us some lebben to drink, the first we have
tasted this year.&nbsp; There were women with them.&nbsp; We also
met a man alone on a very thin del&uacute;l.&nbsp; Mohammed made
some rather uncomplimentary remarks about this animal, whereupon
the owner in great scorn explained that she was a Bint Udeyhan,
the very best breed of dromedaries in Arabia, and that if
Mohammed should offer him a hundred pounds he would not sell her,
that she was the camel always sent by Ibn Rashid on messages
which wanted speed.&nbsp; He then trotted off at a pace which,
though it appeared nothing remarkable, soon took him out of
sight.</p>
<p>Awwad and Ibrahim Kasir have been back to the Haj camp for
water, and have brought news that the Emir has actually arrived,
and a message from him, that if we go on to the wells of Shaybeh
he will meet us there.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 8.&mdash;We have marched fifteen miles to-day
from point to point, making a circuit round Taybetism and are now
encamped at the top of the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; A Shammar boy of
the name of Izzar with three del&uacute;ls came back from the Haj
camp <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>yesterday with Awwad, and he undertakes to show us the
way if we want to go on in front.&nbsp; He would sooner travel
with us than with the Haj, as his beasts are thin, and he is
afraid of their being impressed for the pilgrims.&nbsp; He wants
to drive them unloaded to Meshhed, so that they may grow fat on
the way, and then load them for the home voyage with wheat.&nbsp;
He talks about six or seven days to Meshhed; but Wilfrid insists
that we are not twenty miles nearer Meshhed than when we left
Ha&iuml;l, as we have been travelling almost due east, instead of
nearly due north, and there must be four hundred miles more to
go.&nbsp; This should take us twenty days at least.&nbsp; But the
servants will not believe.&nbsp; We shall see who is right.&nbsp;
They and Mohammed are very unwilling to go on before the Haj, but
now that we have got this boy Izzar we are determined not to
wait.&nbsp; If we delay we shall run short of provisions, which
would be worse than anything.&nbsp; Already, Awwad says, the
pilgrims are complaining loudly that they shall starve if they
are kept longer waiting in this way.&nbsp; They have brought
provisions for so many days and no more, and there is no place
now where they can revictual.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Haj,&rdquo; added
Awwad, &ldquo;is sitting by the fire, very angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our march to-day was enlivened by some hunting, though with no
good result.&nbsp; Sayad and Shiekha coursed a herd of gazelles,
and succeeded in turning them, but could not get hold of any,
though one passed close to Mohammed, who fired without
effect.&nbsp; <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>They made off straight for the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; The
falcon was flown at a houbara (frilled bustard), but the bustard
beat him off, as he is only a last year&rsquo;s bird, and not
entered to anything but hares.&nbsp; Rasham, however, is an
amusement to us and sits on his perch at our tent door.&nbsp;
This spot is pleasant and lonely, within a hundred yards of the
edge of the Nef&ucirc;d.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 9.&mdash;Having sent Izzar to a high point for
a last look back for the Haj and in vain, we have given them up
and now mean to march straight on without them.&nbsp; It is
however annoying that we are still going east instead of north,
coasting the Nefud I suppose to get round instead of crossing it;
but we dare not plunge into it against Izzar&rsquo;s positive
assurance that the other is the only way.&nbsp; Soil sprinkled
with <i>jabsin</i> (talc), and in places with the fruit of the
wild poisonous melon.&nbsp; Passed the well of Beyud (eggs)
thirty feet deep, and travelled six and a half hours, perhaps
eighteen miles, to our present camp absolutely without
incident.&nbsp; Looking at the stars to-night, Mohammed tells me
they call Orion&rsquo;s belt &ldquo;mizan&rdquo; (the balance),
and the pole star &ldquo;el jiddeh&rdquo; (the kid).&nbsp; We now
have milk every day from Izzar&rsquo;s she-camel, a great
luxury.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 10.&mdash;At eight o&rsquo;clock we reached
the wells of Shaybeh.&nbsp; There are forty of them close
together in the middle of a great bare space, with some hills of
white sand to the north of them.&nbsp; The <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>wind was
blowing violently, drifting the sand, and the place looked as
inhospitable a one as could well be imagined, a good excuse for
over-ruling all notions of stopping there, &ldquo;to wait for the
Emir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shaybeh stands on the old Haj road which passes east of
Ha&iuml;l, making straight for Bereydeh in Kas&icirc;m, and the
reason of our travelling so far east is thus explained.&nbsp; Now
we have turned at right angles northwards, and there is a
well-defined track which it will be easy enough for us to follow,
even if we lose our Shammar guide.&nbsp; After leaving the wells,
we travelled for some miles between ridges of white sand, which
the wind was shaping &ldquo;like the snow wreaths in the high
Alps.&rdquo;&nbsp; The white sand, I noticed, is always of a
finer texture than the red, and is more easily affected by the
wind.&nbsp; It carries, moreover, very little vegetation, so that
the mounds and ridges are less permanent than those of the
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; While we were watching them, the wind shifted,
and it was interesting to observe how the summits of the ridges
gradually changed with it, the lee side being always steep, the
wind side rounded.&nbsp; We gradually ascended now through broken
ground to the edge of a level gravelly plain, beyond which about
four miles distant we could see the red line of the real
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; We had nearly crossed this, when we sighted an
animal half a mile away, and galloped off in pursuit, Mohammed
following.&nbsp; I thought at first it must be a wolf or a wild
cow, but as we got nearer to it, we saw that it was a
hy&aelig;na, <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>and it seemed to be carrying something in its
mouth.&nbsp; The dogs now gave chase, and the beast made off as
fast as it could go for the broken ground we had just left, and
where it probably had its den, dropping in its hurry the leg of a
gazelle, the piece of booty it was bringing with it from the
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; The three greyhounds boldly attacked it, Sayad
especially seizing it at the shoulder, but they were unable to
stop it, and it still went on doggedly intent on gaining the
broken ground.&nbsp; It would have escaped had not we got in
front and barred the way.&nbsp; Then it doubled back again, and
we managed to drive it before us towards where we had left our
camels.&nbsp; I never saw so cowardly a creature, for though much
bigger than any dog, it never offered to turn round and defend
itself as a boar or even a jackal would have done, and the dogs
were so persistent in their attacks, that Wilfrid had great
difficulty in getting a clear shot at it, which he did at last,
rolling it over as it cantered along almost under the feet of our
camels.&nbsp; Great of course were the rejoicings, for though
Mohammed and Awwad affected some repugnance, Abdallah declared
boldly and at once, that hyena was &ldquo;khosh lahm,&rdquo;
capital meat.&nbsp; So it was flayed and quartered on the
spot.&nbsp; I confess the look of the carcass was not appetising,
the fat with which it was covered being bright yellow, but
hy&aelig;nas in the desert are not the ghoul-like creatures they
become in the neighbourhood of towns, and on examination <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the stomach
was found to be full of locusts and fresh gazelle meat.&nbsp;
Wilfrid pronounces it eatable, but I, though I have just tasted a
morsel, could not bring myself to make a meal off it.&nbsp; I
perceive that in spite of protestations about unclean food, the
whole of this very large and fat animal has been devoured by our
followers.&nbsp; I am not sure whether Mohammed kept his
resolution of abstaining.</p>
<p>Locusts are now a regular portion of the day&rsquo;s provision
with us, and are really an excellent article of diet.&nbsp; After
trying them in several ways, we have come to the conclusion that
they are best plain boiled.&nbsp; The long hopping legs must be
pulled off, and the locust held by the wings, dipped into salt
and eaten.&nbsp; As to flavour this insect tastes of vegetable
rather than of fish or flesh, not unlike green wheat in England,
and to us it supplies the place of vegetables, of which we are
much in need.&nbsp; The red locust is better eating than the
green one. <a name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; Wilfrid considers that it would
hold its own among the <i>hors d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> at a Paris
restaurant; I am not so sure of this, for on former journeys I
have resolved that other excellent dishes should be adopted at
home, but afterwards among the multitude of luxuries, they have
not been found worth the trouble of preparation.&nbsp; For
catching locusts, the morning is the time, when they are half
benumbed by the cold, and their wings are damp with the dew, so
that they <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>cannot fly; they may then be found clustered in hundreds
under the desert bushes, and gathered without trouble, merely
shovelled into a bag or basket.&nbsp; Later on, the sun dries
their wings and they are difficult to capture, having
intelligence enough to keep just out of reach when pursued.&nbsp;
Flying, they look extremely like May flies, being carried side-on
to the wind.&nbsp; They can steer themselves about as much as
flying fish do, and can alight when they like; in fact, they very
seldom let themselves be drifted against men or camels, and seem
able to calculate exactly the reach of a stick.&nbsp; This year
they are all over the country, in enormous armies by day, and
huddled in regiments under every bush by night.&nbsp; They devour
everything vegetable; and are devoured by everything animal:
desert larks and bustards, ravens, hawks, and buzzards.&nbsp; We
passed to-day through flocks of ravens and buzzards, sitting on
the ground gorged with them.&nbsp; The camels munch them in with
their food, the greyhounds run snapping after them all day long,
eating as many as they can catch.&nbsp; The Bedouins often give
them to their horses, and Awwad says that this year many tribes
have nothing to eat just now but locusts and camels&rsquo; milk;
thus the locust in some measure makes amends for being a
pestilence, by being himself consumed.</p>
<p>We are encamped to-night once more in the Nef&ucirc;d, amongst
the same herbage, and at the edge of one of the same kind of
fuljes, we were <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>accustomed to on our way from J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; This
Nef&ucirc;d however, is intermittent, as there are intervening
tracts of bare ground, between the ridges of sand which here very
distinctly run east and west.&nbsp; The sand is not more than
eighty feet deep, and the fuljes are insignificant compared with
what we saw further west.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 11.&mdash;Some boys with camels joined us last
night, Bedouins from the Abde tribe of Shammar, on their way to
meet the Haj, as they have been ordered up by Ibn Rashid.&nbsp;
They have given us some information about the road.&nbsp; Ibn
Duala is five days&rsquo; journey on; but we shall find the
Dafir, with their Sheykh, Ibn Sueyti, on the second day.&nbsp;
Ibn Sueyti, they say, has a kind of <i>uttfa</i> like Ibn
Shaalan&rsquo;s, but it is pitched like a tent when a battle is
to be fought.&nbsp; The Ajman, near Queyt, have a real uttfa with
ostrich feathers and a girl to sing during the fighting. <a
name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a>&nbsp; They also narrated the following
remarkable tale.</p>
<p>There is, they say, in the desert, five days&rsquo; march from
here to the eastwards, and ten days from Suk es Shi&ocirc;kh on
the Euphrates, a kubr or tomb, the resting-place of a prophet
named Er Refay.&nbsp; It is called Tellateyn el Kharab (the two
hills of the ruins), and near it is a birkeh or tank always full
of water.&nbsp; The tomb has a door which stands open, but round
it there sleeps all day and all night a huge snake, whose mouth
and tail nearly meet, leaving but just room for anyone to pass
in.&nbsp; This it prevents unless the person presenting himself
for entrance is a dervish, and many dervishes go there to
pray.&nbsp; Inside there is a well, and those who enter are
provided (&ldquo;min Allah&rdquo;) for three days with food,
three times a day, but on the fourth they must go.&nbsp; A lion
is chained up by the neck inside the kubr.</p>
<p>The birkeh outside is always full of water, but its shores are
inhabited by snakes, who spit poison into the pool so that
nothing can drink there.&nbsp; But at evening comes the ariel (a
fabulous antelope), who strikes the water with his horns, and by
so doing makes it sweet.&nbsp; Then all the beasts and birds of
the desert follow him, and drink.&nbsp; The Sheykh of the
Montefyk is bound to send camels and guides with all dervishes
who come to him at Suk-es-Shi&ocirc;kh to make the pilgrimage to
Refay.&nbsp; The boys did not say that they had themselves seen
the place.</p>
<p>We are not on the high road now, having left it some miles to
the right, and our march to-day has been mostly through
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; The same swarms of locusts everywhere, and the
same attendant flocks of birds, especially of fine black
buzzards, one of which Abdallah was very anxious to secure if
possible, as he says the wing bones are like ivory, and are used
for inlaying the stocks of guns and stems of pipes.&nbsp; But he
had no success, though he fired several times.&nbsp; Wilfrid was
more fortunate, however, in getting what we value more, a
bustard, <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>and the very best bird we ever ate.&nbsp; Though they
are common enough here, it is seldom that they come within shot,
but this one was frightened by the hawk, and came right
overhead.</p>
<p>About noon, we came to a solitary building, standing in the
middle of the Nef&ucirc;d, called Kasr Torba.&nbsp; It is square,
with walls twenty feet high, and has a tower at each
corner.&nbsp; It is garrisoned by four men, soldiers of Ibn
Rashid&rsquo;s, who surlily refused us admittance, and threatened
to fire on us if we drew water from the well outside.&nbsp; For a
moment we thought of storming the place, which I believe we could
have done without much difficulty, as the door was very rotten
and we were all very angry and thirsty, but second thoughts are
generally accepted as best in Arabia, and on consideration, we
pocketed the affront and went on.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, we overtook a young man and his mother,
travelling with three del&uacute;ls in our direction.&nbsp; They
were on the look-out, they said, for their own people, who were
somewhere in the Nef&ucirc;d, they didn&rsquo;t quite know
where.&nbsp; There are no tracks anywhere, however, and they have
stopped for the night with us.&nbsp; Very nice people, the young
fellow attentive and kind to his mother, making her a shelter
under a bush with the camel saddles.&nbsp; They are Shammar, and
have been on business to Ha&iuml;l.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 12.&mdash;Our disappointment about water
yesterday, has forced us back on to the Haj road <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and the wells
of Khuddra, thirteen or fourteen miles east of last night&rsquo;s
camp.&nbsp; We had, however, some sport on our way.&nbsp; First,
a hare was started and the falcon flown.&nbsp; The Nef&ucirc;d is
so covered with bushes, that without the assistance of the bird
the dogs could have had no chance, for it was only by watching
the hawk&rsquo;s flight that they were able to keep on the
hare&rsquo;s track.&nbsp; It was a pretty sight, the bird above
doubling as the hare doubled, and the three dogs below following
with their noses in the air.&nbsp; We made the best of our way
after them, but the sand being very deep they were soon out of
sight.&nbsp; Suddenly we came to the edge of the Nef&ucirc;d, and
there, a few hundred yards from the foot of the last sand-bank,
we saw the falcon and the greyhounds all sitting in a circle on
the ground, watching a large hole into which the hare had just
bolted.&nbsp; The four pursuers looked so puzzled and foolish,
that in spite of the annoyance of losing the game, we could not
help laughing.&nbsp; Hares in the desert always go to
ground.&nbsp; Mohammed and Abdallah and Awwad were keen for
digging out this one, and they all worked away like navvies for
more than half an hour, till they were up to their shoulders in
the sandy earth (here firm ground), but it was in vain, the hole
was big enough for a hy&aelig;na, and reached down into the rock
below.&nbsp; Further on, however, we had better luck, and having
run another hare to ground, pulled out not only it, but a little
silver grey fox, where they were both <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>crouched together.&nbsp; I do not
think the hares ever dig holes, but they make use of any they can
find when pressed.&nbsp; We also coursed some gazelles.</p>
<p>There are fourteen wells at Khuddra, mere holes in the ground,
without parapet or anything to mark their position, and as we
drew near, we were rather alarmed at finding them occupied by a
large party of Bedouins.&nbsp; It looked like a ghaz&uacute;, for
there were as many men as camels, thirty or forty of them with
spears; and the camels wore shedads instead of pack
saddles.&nbsp; They did not, however, molest us, though their
looks were far from agreeable.&nbsp; They told us they were Dafir
waiting like the rest for the Haj; that their Sheykh, Ibn Sueyti,
was still two days&rsquo; march to the eastwards, beyond Lina,
which is another group of wells something like these; and they
added, that they had heard of us and of our presents to the Emir,
the rifle which fired twelve shots, and the rest.&nbsp; It is
extraordinary how news travels in the desert.&nbsp; I noticed
that Mohammed when questioned by them, said that he was from
Mosul, and he explained afterwards that the Tudmur people had an
old standing blood feud with the Dafir in consequence of some
ghaz&uacute; made long before his time, in which twenty of the
latter were killed. <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a>&nbsp; This has
decided us not to pay Ibn Sueyti the visit we had intended.&nbsp;
It appears that there has been a battle lately between the Dafir
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>and the
Amarrat (&Aacute;nazeh), in which a member of the Ibn Haddal
family was killed.&nbsp; This proves that the &Aacute;nazeh
ghaz&uacute;s sometimes come as far south as the
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; These wells are seventy feet deep, and the
water when first drawn smells of rotten eggs; but the smell goes
off on exposure to the air.</p>
<p>The zodiacal light is very bright this evening; it is
brightest about two hours after sunset, but though I have often
looked out for it, I have never seen it in the morning before
sunrise.&nbsp; It is a very remarkable and beautiful phenomenon,
seen only, I believe, in Arabia.&nbsp; It is a cone of light
extending from the horizon half-way to the zenith, and is rather
brighter than the Milky Way.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 13.&mdash;We have travelled quite twenty-four
miles to-day, having had nothing to distract our attention from
the road, and have reached the first of the reservoirs of
Zobeydeh.</p>
<p>To my surprise this, instead of being on low ground, is as it
were on the top of a hill.&nbsp; At least, we had to ascend quite
two hundred feet to get to it, though there was higher ground
beyond.&nbsp; It is built across a narrow wady of massive
concrete, six feet thick, and is nearly square, eighty yards by
fifty.&nbsp; The inside descends in steps for the convenience of
those who come for water, but a great rent in the masonry has let
most of this out, and now there is only a small mud-hole full of
filthy water in the centre.&nbsp; We found some Arabs there with
their camels, who went away when they saw us, but we <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>sent after
them to make inquiries, and learnt that they were Beni
W&aacute;hari, a new artificial compound tribe of Sher&acirc;rat,
Shammar and others, made up by Ibn Rashid with a slave of his own
for their Sheykh.&nbsp; They are employed in taking care of
camels and mares for the Emir.&nbsp; They talk of eight
days&rsquo; journey now to Meshhed Ali, but Wilfrid says it
cannot be less than fifteen or sixteen.</p>
<p>Mohammed, who has been very anxious to make himself agreeable,
now he is quite away from Ha&iuml;l influences, has been telling
us a number of stories and legends, all more or less connected
with his birthplace Tudmur.&nbsp; He has a real talent as a
narrator, an excellent memory, and that most valuable gift, the
manner of a man who believes what he relates.&nbsp; Here is one
of his tales, a fair specimen of the extraordinary mixture of
fable and historic tradition to be found in all of them:</p>
<p>Suliman ibn Daoud (Solomon, son of David) loved a Nasraniyeh
(a Christian woman), named the Sitt Belkis, <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> and married her.&nbsp; This Christian
lady wished to have a house between Damascus and Irak
(Babylonia), because the air of the desert was good, but no such
a house could be found.&nbsp; Then Solomon, who was king of the
birds as well as king of men, sent for all the birds of the air
to tell him where he should look for the place Belkis desired,
and they all answered his summons but one, Nissr (the eagle), <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>who did not
come.&nbsp; And Solomon asked them if any knew of a spot between
Damascus and Irak, in the desert where the air was good.&nbsp;
But they answered that they knew of none.&nbsp; And he counted
them to see if all were there, and found that the eagle was
missing.&nbsp; Then he sent for the eagle, and they brought him
to Solomon, and Solomon asked him why he had disobeyed the first
summons.&nbsp; And Nissr answered, that he was tending his
father, an old eagle, so old that he had lost all his feathers,
and could not fly or feed himself unless his son was there.&nbsp;
And Solomon asked Nissr if he knew of the place wanted by Belkis;
and Nissr answered that his father knew, for he knew every place
in the world, having lived four thousand years.&nbsp; And Solomon
commanded that he should be brought before him in a box, for the
eagle could not fly.&nbsp; But when they tried to carry the eagle
he was so heavy that they could not lift him.&nbsp; Then Solomon
gave them an ointment, and told them to rub the bird with it and
stroke him thus, and thus, and that he would grow young
again.&nbsp; And they did so, and the feathers grew on his back
and wings, and he flew to Solomon, and alighted before the
throne.&nbsp; And Solomon asked him, &ldquo;where is the palace
that the Sitt Belkis requires, between Damascus and Irak, in the
desert where the air is good?&rdquo; and the eagle answered,
&ldquo;It is Tudmur, the city which lies beneath the
sand.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he showed them the place.&nbsp; And
Solomon ordered the <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>jinns to remove the sand, and when they had done so,
there lay Tudmur with its beautiful ruins and columns.</p>
<p>Still there was no water.&nbsp; For the water was locked up in
a cave in the hills by a serpent twenty thousand double
arms&rsquo; length long, which blocked the mouth of the
cave.&nbsp; And Solomon called on the serpent to come out.&nbsp;
But the serpent answered that she was afraid.&nbsp; And Solomon
promised that he would not kill her.&nbsp; But as soon as she was
half way out of the cave (and they knew it by a black mark on her
body which marked half her length), Solomon set his seal upon her
and she died.&nbsp; And the jinns dragged her wholly out and the
water ran.&nbsp; Still it was poisonous with the venom of the
serpent, and the people could not drink.&nbsp; Then Solomon took
sulphur (kubrit) and threw it into the cave, and the water became
sweet.&nbsp; And the sulphur is found there to this day.</p>
<p>Mohammed says also that ghosts (afrit) are very common among
the ruins at Tudmur&mdash;also (more curious still) that there is
a man at Tudmur more than a hundred years old, and that when he
reached his hundredth year he cut a complete new set of teeth,
and is now able to eat like a young man. <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; So he beguiled the
evening.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 14.&mdash;We have passed more birkehs in
better repair than the first, and being now in the <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>neighbourhood
of water, find a good many Bedouins on the road.&nbsp; Jedur (the
Shammar with the mother, with whom we are still travelling, and
whom we like particularly) knows everybody, and it is well that
he is with us, as some of these Bedouins are rough looking
fellows with hang-dog countenances (especially the Dafir and the
Sellem), which we don&rsquo;t quite like.&nbsp; To-day, as
Wilfrid and I were riding apart from our caravan, a number of men
ran towards us without any salaam aleykum and began calling to us
to stop.&nbsp; But we did not let them get within arm&rsquo;s
length, and bade them ask their questions from a distance.&nbsp;
We shall have to keep watch to-night.&nbsp; The road is now
regularly marked out with a double wall, which we are told was
built by Zobeydeh to hang an awning from, so that the pilgrims
might travel in the shade.&nbsp; But this must be nonsense.&nbsp;
It is more likely that it is merely the effect of the road having
been cleared of the big stones which here cover the plain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Since writing this a curious thing has happened.&nbsp; We
encamped early inside a ruined birkeh and had just got all in
order for the night, when we perceived six men on dromedaries
riding down from the northeast, straight towards us.&nbsp; There
was much speculation of course amongst us, as to who they might
be, honest men or robbers, Shammar or Dafir.&nbsp; <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>They
evidently were not a mere party of camels for the Haj, as each
del&uacute;l was mounted by a man with a lance, and they came on
at a trot.&nbsp; They rode straight to where we were, made their
camels kneel down, took off khurjs and shedads and then arranged
their bivouac for the night.&nbsp; Then they came up to our tents
and accosted Mohammed and the servants, who of course invited
them to sit down and drink coffee.&nbsp; Mohammed presently came
to us and whispered that he felt convinced they were Dafir, but
that we should presently know for certain.&nbsp; They sat down
and began talking on general subjects, as the custom is till
coffee has been served, but afterwards Mohammed asked them whence
they had come and whither they were going.&nbsp; They answered
that they were Ketherin, sent by their Sheykh to Ha&iuml;l on
business, and explained further that their object was to find a
certain relative of their Sheykh&rsquo;s whom he had heard of as
being a guest at Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s and to invite him to their
tents.&nbsp; Perhaps we might have heard of him, his name was
Mohammed ibn Ar&ucirc;k.&nbsp; And their Sheykh&rsquo;s
name?&nbsp; Muttlak ibn Ar&ucirc;k!&nbsp; Here is a <i>coup de
th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>!&nbsp; Mohammed&rsquo;s long-lost
relation, the third brother of the three who left Aared in the
eighteenth century and parted company at J&ocirc;f, has been
discovered in his descendant, whose servants are at this moment
in our camp.&nbsp; Imagine the joy of Mohammed and the triumph of
so appropriate an occasion for reciting once more the kasid Ibn
Ar&ucirc;k!&nbsp; The rhymes of <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>that well-known legend, recited by
Mohammed and responded to by the new comers in chorus, were
indeed the first intimation we had of what had happened.&nbsp;
Then the Ketherin ambassadors were brought to our tent and their
story told.&nbsp; Now all ideas of Bussorah and Meshhed Ali and
the Haj are abandoned, and, for the moment, there is no other
plan for any of us but an immediate visit to these new
relations.&nbsp; One of the Ketherin has already started off
homewards to announce the joyful event, and the rest will turn
back with us to-morrow.&nbsp; Muttlak&rsquo;s tents are not more
than a day&rsquo;s journey from where we now are, and we shall
see these long-lost cousins to-morrow before the sun goes
down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yallah,&rdquo; exclaimed Mohammed, beaming
with joy and pride.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 15.&mdash;We made a late start, for Mohammed
has lost his head again and is playing the fine gentleman, as he
did at Ha&iuml;l, afraid or ashamed to be seen by his new
acquaintances doing any sort of work.&nbsp; Instead of helping to
pack or load the camels, he would do nothing but sit on the
ground playing with his beads, and calling to Awwad to saddle his
del&uacute;l,&mdash;airs and graces which, I am glad to see, are
thrown away on the Ketherin, who, as Bedouins, care little for
the vanities of life.&nbsp; Even when started, we did not get
far, for it began to thunder and lighten, and presently to rain
heavily, so that Wilfrid ordered a halt at half-past ten.&nbsp;
We have now come to the great birkehs which <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>are full of
water.&nbsp; They stand in a valley called the Wady Roseh, from a
plant of that name which grows in it, and is much prized as
pasture for both camels and horses.&nbsp; There are two tanks
near us, one round, the other square, and both of the same
fashion as the first we saw.&nbsp; We have been examining the
construction and find that the walls were originally built
hollow, of stone, and filled up with concrete.&nbsp; This is now
as hard as granite, and has a fine polish on the surface.&nbsp;
The water is beautifully clear and good.&nbsp; The largest of the
tanks is sixty-four yards by thirty-seven, and perhaps twelve
feet deep.&nbsp; There is a ruined khan of the same date close
by, and Wilfrid has discovered an immense well ten feet wide at
the mouth and very deep.&nbsp; All these were constructed by
Zobeydeh, the wife of the Caliph Haroun er-Rashid, who nearly
died of thirst on her way back from Mecca and so had the wells
and tanks dug.&nbsp; Wilfrid believes that no European has
visited them before, though they are marked vaguely on
Chesney&rsquo;s map.&nbsp; A wild day has ended with a fine
sunset.&nbsp; Dinner, not of stalled ox, nor of herbs, but of
boiled locusts and rice, with such bread as we can manage to make
of flour well mixed with sand.</p>
<p>Mohammed, who has been in the agonies of poetic composition
for a week past, has at last delivered himself of the following
kas&iacute;d or ballad, which I believe is intended as a pendant
to the original Ibn Ar&ucirc;k kas&iacute;d, with which he sees
we are bored.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Muttlak Ibn Ar&ucirc;k and the
Ketherin&mdash;Their horses&mdash;We are adopted by the
tribe&mdash;The Haj again&mdash;Ambar sends round the hat&mdash;A
forced march of one hundred and seventy miles&mdash;Terrible loss
of camels&mdash;Nejef.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 16.&mdash;Two Asian Shammar of the Jezireh
came last night, and recognised us as having been in Ferhan
Pasha&rsquo;s camp, last year, in Mesopotamia,&mdash;a very
pleasant meeting, though we have no distinct recollection of
either of them.&nbsp; They gave us all the latest Jezireh news in
politics.&nbsp; Ferhan and his brother Faris are now at open war,
though Ferhan is no fighter himself, and leaves the conduct of
affairs to his eldest son, Aassa.&nbsp; All the Shammar of the
Jezireh are with Faris, except Ferhan&rsquo;s own tail, and the
Abde, and the Asslan, Muttany&rsquo;s men, and our old friend
Smeyr ibn-Zeydan.&nbsp; It is true also that Faris is now friends
with Jedaan.&nbsp; All this we are glad to hear.</p>
<p>This morning, Jedur and his mother left us, as they are not
going any further our way.&nbsp; I like them both, and should
have been glad to give the mother some small remembrance of our
journey together, but, as Arabs do, they went away without <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>saying
good-bye.&nbsp; Our march to-day was a short one, nine or ten
miles, still down the Wady Roseh, where water has actually been
running since the late storm, and where there are pools still
here and there, and a large swamp full of ducks, storks, and
snipe,&mdash;the first water above ground we have seen since the
Wady er-Rajel, nearly two months ago.&nbsp; There is capital
grass, too, in the wady, a few inches high, which our hungry
mares enjoy thoroughly.&nbsp; As we were stopping to let them and
the camels graze on a particularly inviting spot, suddenly we
perceived about thirty del&uacute;l riders coming over the hill
to our right.&nbsp; Although it was probable that this was
Muttlak, we all prepared for defence, making the camels kneel
down, and seizing each his best weapon,&mdash;Wilfrid the rifle,
I the gun, and Mohammed his large revolver.&nbsp; Awwad stood
ready, sword in hand, and Abdallah squatted with his long gun
pointed towards the new-comers; the rest, except Izzar, who
possesses a sword, had only sticks, but made a formidable
appearance.</p>
<p>There was no need, however, for alarm, for, presently, one of
the approaching party detached himself from the rest, and
trotting his dromedary towards us, saluted us in a loud voice,
and we saw that it was Hazzam, the man who had gone on to
announce our coming to Muttlak.&nbsp; In another five minutes the
Sheykh himself had dismounted.&nbsp; There was of course a great
deal of kissing and embracing between Mohammed and his new found
relations, <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>and Wilfrid came in for a share of it.&nbsp; Muttlak is
a charming old man, very quiet and very modest, but possessed of
considerable dignity.&nbsp; He has an expression of extreme
kindness and gentleness which is very attractive, and we already
like him better than any of Mohammed&rsquo;s J&ocirc;f
relations.&nbsp; Unlike the Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks of J&ocirc;f and
Tudmur, this branch of the family has remained Bedouin, and
unmixed by any fellahin alliances.&nbsp; Mohammed&rsquo;s rather
vulgar pretensions to birth and dignity have fallen, ashamed
before the simplicity of this good old man, the true
representative of the Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks of Aared, and though the
kas&iacute;d has been trotted out once more, and the family
genealogy stated and compared, it has been with modesty and
decorum, and the sadness which befits decayed fortunes.&nbsp;
There can be no question here who shall take the upper place, the
Sheykh himself being always ready to take the lowest.&nbsp; To us
he is charming in his attentions, and without false dignity in
his thanks for the small presents <a name="citation75"></a><a
href="#footnote75" class="citation">[75]</a> we have made
him.&nbsp; He is to stay with us to-night, and then he will take
us to his tents to-morrow.</p>
<p>Muttlak has brought us three sheep for a present.&nbsp; He has
with him a very handsome falcon, a lanner like ours, but
larger.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 17.&mdash;We left our camp in the Wady Roseh,
where Muttlak told us there was better pasture than we should
find with him, and rode off <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>on our mares to pay him a morning
visit and return at night.&nbsp; Muttlak has with him his own
little mare, the counterpart of himself, old and without other
pretension than extreme purity of descent.&nbsp; She is a
keh&icirc;let Omm Jerass (mother of bells), and was once in Ibn
Saoud&rsquo;s stables.&nbsp; It is difficult to describe her, for
her merits are not on the surface; I am sure nine out of ten
English dealers would pass her over, if they saw her at
Tattersall&rsquo;s or Barnet Fair, as an insignificant little
pony.&nbsp; She is very small, hardly over 13 hands, for even
Mohammed&rsquo;s mokhra looks tall beside her, chestnut with four
white feet and a blaze, a good but not a pretty head, and, but
for a proud carriage of the tail, no style or action; an old
brood mare never ridden except on state occasions like the
present, for on ordinary occasions no Arab of Nejd thinks of
riding anything but a del&uacute;l.&nbsp; As Muttlak said, very
gravely, &ldquo;When God has given you a mare that is
<i>asil</i>, it is not that <i>you</i> should ride, but that
<i>she</i> should breed foals.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man stuck to
his del&uacute;l, and the little mare was ridden by his cousin
Shatti, who went with us, and gave us some valuable information
by the way.&nbsp; The Ketherin, like all the tribes of Nejd, were
formerly under Ibn Saoud.&nbsp; They are a branch of the Beni
Khalid, who, in their turn, are a branch of the Beni Laam, an
ancient and noble tribe, of which the main stock is still found
between Aared and Kat&icirc;f, while another branch settled some
centuries ago beyond the Tigris, on the Persian frontier.&nbsp;
The <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>Ketherin are now few in number and decayed in
circumstances, but Shatti informed us, with some pride, they can
still turn out a hundred khayal on occasion; that is to say, if
they are attacked and obliged to fight.&nbsp; This shows more
than anything the small number of horses possessed by the tribes
of Nejd.&nbsp; I asked Shatti which of the tribes still under Ibn
Saoud are now most in repute as breeders of horses; and he told
me the Muteyr or Dushan (for it seems they have both names), who
could turn out four hundred horsemen.&nbsp; Their best breeds are
Keh&icirc;lan Ajuz, Keh&icirc;lan el-Krush, Abeyan Sherrak,
Maneghy Hedruj, and Rabdan Kesheyban.&nbsp; They have no Seglawis
at all; the Krushiehs of Ibn Rashid came originally from them,
Feysul having bought them from the tribe.&nbsp; It must not,
however, be supposed, he said, that all the Dushan mares were
asil.&nbsp; The Dushan, like every other tribe in Nejd and
elsewhere, has &ldquo;mehassaneh,&rdquo; or half-breds, what the
&Aacute;nazeh would call &ldquo;beni&rdquo; or &ldquo;banat
hossan;&rdquo; that is to say, animals with a stain in their
pedigree, and therefore not asil, though often nearly as good and
as good-looking.&nbsp; Their own breeds (that is to say, the
Ketherin&rsquo;s) are principally Wadnan, Rishan, Rabdan, and
Shueyman.&nbsp; As we got near the Ketherin tents we met two men
on a del&uacute;l, leading a lovely little bay colt, one of the
prettiest I ever saw, which Shatti told us was a Wadnan
Horsan.</p>
<p>After nearly three hours&rsquo; riding we arrived at <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the <i>buyut
shaar</i> (houses of hair), and were soon being hospitably
entertained.&nbsp; It is the custom here, as it is in the Sahara,
that the Sheykh should receive illustrious strangers, not in his
own tent, but in a special tent set up for the purpose.&nbsp; It
was a poor place, little more than an awning, but the welcome was
hearty and sincere.&nbsp; Here all the principal people of the
tribe assembled as soon as the news of our arrival spread, and a
feast was prepared of tummin and fresh butter, and naga&rsquo;s
milk.&nbsp; The Arabs, never kill a lamb except for the evening
meal.</p>
<p>After this entertainment I went to visit Muttlak&rsquo;s
family, and on my return I found Wilfrid inspecting the mares
which we had already seen grazing near the tents.&nbsp; There
were half-a-dozen of them, fair average animals, but nothing
first-rate, or so handsome as the Wadnan colt, nor any over
fourteen hands high.&nbsp; We were looking at these rather
disappointedly, when Hazzam ibn Ar&ucirc;k, Muttlak&rsquo;s
brother, rode up on a really beautiful mare, which he told us was
a Seglawieh Jedran, the only one left in Nejd.&nbsp; He added
that they had been obliged to conceal the name of her breed for
some years on account of the danger incurred of her being taken
by force.&nbsp; In former times, when the Wahhabis were all
powerful, any famous mare ran great risk of being seized for the
Riad stables.&nbsp; Ibn Saoud would declare war with a tribe
merely as an excuse for robbing it of its mares.&nbsp; Ibn
Rashid, at the present day, put great pressure on the owners of
valuable mares to make them sell; <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>but he paid for what he took.&nbsp;
This mare had been often asked about both for Ibn Rashid, and for
Nassr el-Ashgar, Sheykh of the Montefyk, who (or rather his
brother Fahad now) has the best collection of horses after Ibn
Rashid and Ibn Saoud.&nbsp; She is a fine bright bay,
muttlak-el-yemin, snip on the nose; has a splendid way of moving
when ridden, action like Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s mare at Ha&iuml;l,
<i>handsome</i> rather than <i>racing</i>.&nbsp; The head is
good, the eye bright and large, the forehead rather flat, the
jowl deep; the wither high and back short, quarters round, like
all the Nejd horses, sinews good, and hoofs large and round.</p>
<p>Hazzam&rsquo;s mare is under fourteen hands, but stands over
much ground, and ought to be up to weight, being wonderfully
compact.&nbsp; We had some hopes at one moment of being able to
purchase her, and for a good price and money down I think it
might have been done, for they are all most anxious to oblige
us.&nbsp; But we have no money and our cheque on Bagdad would be
difficult for them to cash.&nbsp; The Ketherin are this year in
great distress, as there was no autumn rain, and until a month
ago, nothing that horses can eat.&nbsp; They are without corn or
even dates, and but for the locusts, which have been abundant all
the winter, they must have starved.&nbsp; Indeed locusts are
still their main article of food, for man as well as beast.&nbsp;
Great piles of these insects, dried over the fire, may be seen in
every tent.</p>
<p>Amid a general chorus of good wishes, we at last took our
leave of these good people.&nbsp; &ldquo;You,&rdquo; they <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>said to
Wilfrid, &ldquo;shall be our Sheykh whenever you return to
us.&nbsp; Muttlak will not be jealous.&nbsp; We will make war for
you on all your enemies, and be friends with your
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; Muttlak himself has promised that there
shall be a general council to-night to decide whether the tribe
shall move northwards as has been proposed, or not, and that if
it is decided that it shall be so, he will join us to-morrow
morning, and travel with us to Meshhed to make arrangements with
the intervening tribes, whose consent must first be
obtained.&nbsp; It is strange what friendship we have made with
these simple-hearted people in a few hours.&nbsp; We are the
first Europeans they have seen, and they look upon us as beings
of a superior world.</p>
<p>As we came back to the crest of the hill overlooking Wady
Roseh, we saw away to the south a smoke rising&mdash;the Haj.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 18.&mdash;We had walked down to the birkeh to
try and stalk some ducks when the first runners of the Haj
arrived, and presently the Haj itself, now swelled to double its
former size, swept past us down the Wady.&nbsp; At the same
moment Muttlak appeared on his del&uacute;l ready to go with
us.&nbsp; This gave us great pleasure.&nbsp; He has got the
consent of his tribe, and what is of more importance of the women
of his family, to go with us to Meshhed Ali, and see what
arrangements can be made with the &Aacute;nazeh Sheykhs for a
migration of the Ketherin northwards.&nbsp; Such migrations have,
I fancy, taken place in all ages among the Bedouins of Arabia;
the want of pasture constantly driving them outwards from Central
Arabia to the richer deserts of Syria and Mesopotamia.&nbsp; In
this way the Shammar and the &Aacute;nazeh obtained their present
inheritance of the Ham&aacute;d and the Jezireh, and thus in
still earlier times the Ta&iuml; abandoned Nejd.</p>

<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Muttlak&rsquo;s equipment for the journey is of the
simplest kind, the clothes in which he stands.&nbsp; He and a
single attendant are mounted together on an old black dromedary,
the Sheykh perched on the saddle, and his man kneeling behind,
their only weapon a stick, and they guide the del&uacute;l with a
rope passed through a hole in his nostril, a primitive
arrangement.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; we said to Mohammed,
&ldquo;that is how your ancestors left Nejd.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old
man is very pious; unlike the &Aacute;nazeh and other tribes of
the north, these Bedouins of Nejd say their prayers regularly,
and profess the Mussulman creed, and Muttlak&rsquo;s first act on
dismounting this evening in camp, was to go apart with his
attendant and pray.&nbsp; Mohammed and Abdallah still say their
prayers occasionally, though with less and less fervour as the
distance from Ha&iuml;l grows greater.&nbsp; Awwad&rsquo;s
devotion is of a very varying quality, sometimes quite
imperceptible, at others almost alarming.&nbsp; I have noticed
that any special stress of work in loading the camels of a
morning, or pitching the tents at night, is sure to call forth a
burst of spiritual fervour.&nbsp; At such times his <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>la-ilaha-illa-llah goes on for a prodigious length of
time, and may be heard a quarter of a mile off.</p>
<p>Ambar, the negro emir-el-haj, has brought a polite message for
us from Ibn Rashid.&nbsp; He came with the Haj as far as Khuddra,
and then went back to Ha&iuml;l, so we have lost nothing by not
going with him on his intended ghaz&uacute;.</p>
<p>Having camped early we sent Abdallah and Hanna to the Haj to
find out our Persian friends there, and invite them to dine with
us, as we had killed a sheep, and just before sunset they
arrived, Ali Koli Khan, Huseyn Koli Khan, and Abd er-Rahim of
Kermanshah.&nbsp; We seated them all on a carpet outside our
little tent, for it is a warm evening, and then the dinner was
served.&nbsp; But much to our vexation, for we had carefully
arranged the entertainment, they refused to eat anything, first
saying that they had already dined, and afterwards admitting that
the Mollahs in whose company they were travelling, had forbidden
their eating with us during the Haj.&nbsp; They were very polite,
however, and made all sorts of apologies, and even took one
mouthful each to avoid being positively rude.&nbsp; Ali said that
but for his mother&rsquo;s Mollah, he would have asked us to dine
with him, for he has a good cook, but under the circumstances it
cannot be.&nbsp; Huseyn, who is the son of an ex-vizier,
pretended to speak French, but the only complete phrase which he
had at command, and which seemed borrowed from a copy-book, was,
&ldquo;L&rsquo;Arabe est charlatan.&rdquo;&nbsp; This he <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>repeated in
and out of season, whenever there was a pause in the
conversation.&nbsp; These Persians were as loud as ever in their
complaints against the Arabs, and being now out of his dominions,
did not spare the Emir, whom they accused of having plundered
them terribly.&nbsp; They also had much to tell of the extortions
of the hemeldaria, or contractors for the Haj.</p>
<p>It appears that each pilgrim, when he starts for Mecca, puts
himself into the hands of an Arab contractor, generally a native
of Meshhed Ali, who undertakes to provide him with transport,
either in the shape of riding dromedaries, or litters, or even in
some cases, mules or horses.&nbsp; He does this for a sum of
money down, accepting all risks, and is bound to replace any
animal that breaks down or dies on the road, with another at a
moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; It is a very speculative business,
as if all goes well with the Haj, the hemeldaria makes a fortune,
whereas if things go badly, he may lose one.&nbsp; In some years
great numbers of camels die, and then the contractors are ruined;
but generally they make a very good thing out of it, as their
charges are enormous.&nbsp; At any rate they seem very rich, and
ride about themselves on the finest dromedaries in the Haj, and
wear the finest clothes.&nbsp; There are twenty of these
contractors now with the Haj, who divide the two thousand Persian
pilgrims amongst them.&nbsp; Besides the Persians there are about
a hundred Shias from Bagdad and Bussorah, but these do not mix
much with the Persians, and a body-guard of about a thousand
Bedouins, Ibn <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>Rashid&rsquo;s people.&nbsp; In all, over three thousand
persons, with five thousand camels.&nbsp; It must be like the
journey of the children of Israel to Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>Ali Koli Khan left Ha&iuml;l with the Emir, nearly a week
after we did, so we did not need to be in any hurry, but I think
we were right to get clear away while we could.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 19.&mdash;An early start before sunrise,
though there were stragglers till seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We
were the last to go, but we had sent our camels on as there was
good grass, and we wanted our mares to have a comfortable
feed.&nbsp; Occasionally one of the pilgrims would come and sit
down a moment by our fire to warm his hands.&nbsp; We have now
quite left the Nef&ucirc;d, and are travelling over broken stony
ground.&nbsp; The Haj marches fast, quite three miles an hour,
and there is no stopping on the way.&nbsp; We are halted this
evening at the last of the reservoirs of Zobeydeh, the Birkeh
Jemaymeh (Jemima&rsquo;s pool).&nbsp; Here there are considerable
ruins and a very large well.</p>
<p>The boy Izzar has left us, I am sorry to say, and he is sorry
too.&nbsp; He was very serviceable and pleasant, and we lose with
him his naga&rsquo;s milk, which we have been drinking fresh
every morning.&nbsp; (N.B.&nbsp; We will never travel again
without a she camel for milk.)&nbsp; But his del&uacute;ls have
been impressed for the Haj.&nbsp; We gave him three mejidies
(about ten shillings) for his ten days&rsquo; service, which
brought down blessings on our heads.&nbsp; I do not think he
expected anything.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span><i>February</i> 20.&mdash;Again the Haj has come to a
stand-still, to the renewed wrath of the pilgrims.&nbsp; It is
now twenty days since they left Ha&iuml;l and not more than half
the journey has been accomplished.&nbsp; There are two hundred
miles more of road, and their provisions, calculated for three
weeks, are all but run out.&nbsp; What makes this new delay the
more aggravating to them is that it has been ordered by the negro
Ambar, so that he may send the hat round for a private
contribution to his own benefit.&nbsp; He has made it known that
two mejidies a head is what he expects, and that he will not move
till the sum is forthcoming.&nbsp; This will be a nice little
purse for him, something like eight hundred pounds, and we
maintain a fleet in the Red Sea to suppress the slave trade, out
of motives of humanity!&nbsp; The Persians are powerless to
resist, for without the black man&rsquo;s order, not a camel
would move.&nbsp; We, as Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s guests, are exempted
from all toll or tax whatever, but we want to get on.&nbsp;
Fortunately we laid in a whole month&rsquo;s provisions at
Ha&iuml;l.</p>
<p>The day has been a very hot one, and we have had the tent
propped up all round, so that it resembles a gigantic
umbrella.&nbsp; It is pitched on a hill overlooking the Haj, and
has attracted a good many visitors.&nbsp; The first of them was a
certain Seyd Mustafa, a native of Shustar in Persia, but speaking
Arabic well.&nbsp; He is travelling as interpreter with Ali Koli
Khan, and has given us some <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>information about the country between
Bagdad and his own town.&nbsp; Ali Koli has several times
proposed that we should go on with him from Bagdad, to pay a
visit to his father in the Bactiari mountains, and Wilfrid is
very much bent on doing this.</p>
<p>He himself is going round by the river to Bussorah, and then
up the Karun to Shustar, a plan which would not suit us; but Seyd
Mustafa says he will go with us by land, though it is a very
difficult country to get through.&nbsp; The frontier between
Turkey and Persia is occupied by the Beni Laam who recognise
neither the Sultan nor the Shah.&nbsp; The Beni Laam however,
ought to receive us well from our connection with the Ibn
Ar&ucirc;ks, and a visit to them would almost complete our
acquaintance with the Arab tribes north of Nejd.</p>
<p>Next two poor women came, an old and a young one, dressed
alike in white rags.&nbsp; They are from Bagdad, and have made
the pilgrimage barefoot and begging their bread.&nbsp; One of
them carries a tin mug, into which somebody had just thrown a
handful of barley.&nbsp; I gave them a loaf of bread, with which
they went away invoking blessings on me.&nbsp; They seem
perfectly contented and happy.</p>
<p>Then we had a visit from some Bagdadis; one had been a
soldier, the others shopkeepers.&nbsp; They were pilgrims,
however, now, and not on business, as most of the Arabs here
are.</p>
<p>Next a Dafir boy, with a lamb and a skin of fresh butter to
sell, the butter mixed up with <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>date-skins and hair, and coloured
yellow with a plant called saffron.&nbsp; After much haggling
(for stinginess in a purchaser inspires respect) we bought the
lamb and the butter for a mejidie&mdash;four shillings.</p>
<p>Next a Jinfaneh Shammar, with a bay horse, also for sale, a
Keh&icirc;lan Ajuz fourteen hands, with good jowl, good shoulder,
and tail well carried, but rather small eye, thick nose, and
coarse hind quarter&mdash;altogether strong with plenty of
bone&mdash;aged, very much aged!&nbsp; We do not want him.</p>
<p>Then an Ibn Duala, with a Wadneh mare, also bay, thirteen
hands three inches, or fourteen hands&mdash;pretty head, with
projecting forehead, very good jowl, good shoulder, but thick
nose and coarse hindquarter, rather high on the legs, with a good
deal of hair on the fetlocks.&nbsp; They all seem to have the
same faults.</p>
<p>I asked the Jinfaneh Shammar about the well of Wakisa, marked
on Chesney&rsquo;s map as eight hundred feet deep, but he laughed
and said, &ldquo;forty of these,&rdquo; holding out his arms, and
Muttlak confirmed the statement; this would make it two hundred
and forty, a much more probable depth.</p>
<p>Wilfrid in the meanwhile had been with Seyd Mustafa and
Mohammed to the Haj, and had had tea with Huseyn Koli Khan.&nbsp;
They also called on Ambar and Ali Koli Khan; but both were
out.&nbsp; Most of the pilgrims were lying on their backs asleep
in the sun.&nbsp; It was very hot.</p>
<p>Ambar&rsquo;s little white mare has been brought to <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>graze near
our tents, for as usual we have chosen the best pasture for our
camp.&nbsp; The slave with her says she is a Krushieh.&nbsp; She
is a flea-bitten grey, very old and very small, but for her size
powerful, with a good head, though not a handsome one, a very
fine shoulder with high wither, the usual Nejd hindquarter and
manner of carrying the tail, legs like iron.&nbsp; To complete
the picture, I must mention one knee swelled, all four feet much
out of shape with long standing in the yard at Ha&iuml;l, and
very hairy heels.&nbsp; There are with the Haj several yearling
colts bought by the hemeldaria for sale at Bagdad, scraggy little
things more like goats than horses.</p>
<p>The sun has brought out a huge tarantula from the sand close
to our tent.&nbsp; It is the first venomous reptile I have seen
on the journey.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 21.&mdash;Ambar seems determined to make up
for lost time, and he has hurried the Haj on all day so that we
have done over thirty miles.&nbsp; Our road has been through
broken ground, the Wady el-Buttn (the valley of the stomach),
where we saw a fox and some hares.&nbsp; One of these last the
dogs caught after a long course, and another was run to
ground.&nbsp; Abd er-Rahim, the Kermanshahi, rode with us a part
of the day, mounted on the most lovely del&uacute;l that was ever
seen; she is of a bright chestnut colour, with a coat like satin,
a light fine mane rather darker than the rest, eyes more
beautiful than those of the gazelle, and a style of going which I
have not seen equalled by any <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>other camel.&nbsp; This del&uacute;l
can canter and gallop as well as trot, and kept up with us very
fairly when we were chasing the hare, though of course she could
not really command a horse&rsquo;s pace.&nbsp; Abd er-Rahim and
Ali Koli Khan now both ride del&uacute;ls, and have dressed
themselves up in Arab fashion, all silk and gold, the
mean-looking little Kurd being thus transformed into a fine
gentleman.&nbsp; Their saddles, bridles, and trappings are also
very gay, got up regardless of expense.&nbsp; They hired their
del&uacute;ls of Ibn Rashid for the journey, I forget exactly for
what sum, but it was a good deal of money.&nbsp; The Persians
will not eat hare; and Ali Koli Khan, who is travelling with a
private chaplain, would not join us in our sport.&nbsp; Indeed he
seems now to keep rather aloof from us, but Abd er-Rahim has no
such scruples.&nbsp; We hear that a sermon was preached yesterday
in camp, against the sin of holding intercourse with kaffirs.</p>
<p>This has been a long, tedious march, two of our camels being
tired.&nbsp; We have come to the end of our provision of flour
for them, and there is really very little they can eat on the
road.&nbsp; Wilfrid makes it still a hundred and forty miles to
Meshhed.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 22.&mdash;We travelled yesterday through a
low-lying district, bounded by cliffs a little in the style of
J&ocirc;f (it is all called <i>el buttn</i>, the stomach), and
this morning, soon after starting, we reached the end of it, and
had to ascend two or three hundred feet, the last <i>akabah</i>
or ascent being very steep.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Here
there was a great confusion, as the road was narrowed to a single
track, and the Haj had to go almost in single file, instead of in
line, its usual way of travelling.&nbsp; The steepness of the
cliff proved too much for more than one camel, tired as they were
with yesterday&rsquo;s march and want of food.&nbsp; Among them
poor Shenuan, the ugly camel of our string, gave in.&nbsp; He is
not old, but has long been ailing, and for the last week has
carried nothing but his pack-saddle, and been nothing but a
trouble to us, still it cost us a pang to abandon him.&nbsp; He
has had mange from the very beginning of our journey; in fact, he
was the only camel of those originally purchased by Mohammed for
us, to which we demurred at the outset.&nbsp; Our objections were
overruled by Mohammed&rsquo;s arguments, that Shenuan&rsquo;s
youth and strength would enable him to get over the effects of
mange, but he never prospered, and did not recover from the
fatigue of the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; Poor fellow, he was very loath
to be left behind, and struggled on till he came to this hill,
which was too much for him.&nbsp; We left him, I am glad to say,
in a bit of wady where there was some grass, but I fear his
chance is a small one.&nbsp; Camels seldom recover when they get
past a certain stage of exhaustion.&nbsp; They break their
hearts, like deer, and die.&nbsp; Poor Shenuan!&nbsp; I shall not
easily forget his face, looking wistfully after his companions as
they disappeared over the crest of the hill.&nbsp; He is the
first of our small party that has fallen out of the <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>ranks, and we
are depressed with the feeling that he may not be the last.</p>
<p>At the top of the cliff we came to a perfectly level plain,
strewn with fine flints, and across this we have travelled all
day.&nbsp; Its height above the sea is 1460 feet, and we find
that ever since leaving Shaybeh, where the road turned north, we
have been descending at an average rate of about ten feet per
mile, but the descent is not regular, because of these cliffs
which we have come to, which have all been, in a sense, contrary
to the general declivity of the ground.&nbsp; About mid-day we
came to a great pool of rain-water, at which the camels drank and
the goat-skins were filled, a very welcome accident.&nbsp; Our
march to-day was twenty-four miles.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 23.&mdash;The flinty plain is called
Mahamiyeh, and with the Buttn forms a neutral ground between the
Shammar and the &Aacute;nazeh, who are here represented by the
Amarrat, their Sheykh Ibn Haddal.&nbsp; It was somewhere about
here that the battle was fought the other day, in which the Dafir
got the best of it, and some of the Ibn Haddal were killed.&nbsp;
The consequence of its being thus neutral is, that the Mahamiyeh
is covered with dry grass of last year, uneaten by any flocks, a
great boon to us; for there is no fresh grass yet.</p>
<p>Beyond the Mahamiyeh we came again to hills, amongst which we
found the wells of Sherab, and beyond this again the ground
sloped downwards until we came to a regular valley, which we <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>followed in
its windings all the afternoon.&nbsp; This is the Wady Shebekkeh,
which narrows in one place almost to a ravine.&nbsp; There water
had evidently flowed not long ago, and we found some beautiful
clear pools, beside which the Haj is camped.&nbsp; We ourselves
are some two miles further on, where there is better
pasture.&nbsp; The Haj camels are getting terribly thin.&nbsp;
These forced marches (we came twenty-eight miles to-day) are
telling on them, and their owners are complaining loudly.&nbsp;
The pilgrims having only hired the camels, of course care nothing
for their welfare, and will not let them graze as they go,
because riding a camel which eats as it goes is rather
tiresome.&nbsp; Then in the evening the tents have to be pitched
in some spot where a large camp can stand altogether,
irrespective of considerations of pasture, the poor camels often
having to go two or three miles to their food.&nbsp; We manage
better, and always choose our spot for their sakes more than our
own.&nbsp; Two of our camels nevertheless are tired, but our
camels are loaded far more heavily than those of the
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>To-night we have had a long and serious talk with Muttlak
about the Ketherin tribe, in which we now consider we have an
interest.&nbsp; He promises that he will really come north as
soon as he can make arrangements with the Sebaa, and we have in
return promised him that we will set up a &ldquo;house of
hair&rdquo; with them, and keep a few nagas and a mare or two,
and a small flock of sheep.&nbsp; This <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>would be very agreeable, and serve as
a <i>pied &agrave; terre</i> in the desert, quite independent of
all the world.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 24.&mdash;Another <i>akabah</i> had to be
climbed to-day&mdash;another long winding road followed across
another open plain.&nbsp; The wonder is why the road should wind
where there is no obstacle to avoid and no object to reach by a
circuit.&nbsp; But such is always the case.&nbsp; Everybody
seemed cross with the hard work, enlivened only by an occasional
course, in which the hare sometimes ran right in among the
pilgrims, when there was a scrimmage with the dervishes for
possession of the quarry.&nbsp; The dervishes, who are mostly
from Bagdad, are ready to eat hare or anything else they can get,
indeed everybody is at starvation point.&nbsp; The only cheerful
one of our party is the stalwart Ibrahim, who has come out again
now as a wag.&nbsp; To-day, as we were marching along, we passed
a fat Persian on a very little donkey, whom Ibrahim began
chaffing, but finding the Persian did not understand him, he ran
up, and seizing hold, lifted donkey and man in his arms.&nbsp; I
could not have believed it possible, had I not seen that the
donkey&rsquo;s four legs were off the ground.&nbsp; The Persian
did not seem to understand this joke better than the rest, but
they are stolid people, and have had a long breaking in and
experience in patience during the last four months.</p>
<p>We have found a peaceful spot for the night, with plenty of
pasture and plenty of &ldquo;jelleh&rdquo; for fuel.&nbsp; The
sun has set, but in the clear cold sky <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>there is a nearly new moon, which
gives a certain amount of light.</p>
<p>Wilfrid is making plans for spending the spring in Persia, and
the summer in India, regardless of such news as may meet us at
Bagdad from England or elsewhere.&nbsp; Such plans, however
pleasant as they are in the planning, cannot be counted on.&nbsp;
Much may have happened in the three months since we have been cut
off from all communication with Europe, or indeed any part of the
world out of Arabia, and even the traveller most detached from
all affections or thoughts of his distant home is liable to be
seized by a sudden longing for green fields with buttercups and
daisies.&nbsp; The passing note of a bird or the scent of a
flower may be enough to upset a most admirably contrived
plan.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 25.&mdash;Twenty-seven miles of march
yesterday, and thirty to-day.</p>
<p>The camels cannot last at this pace, but the Haj is pushing on
now because the men are starving.&nbsp; It is said that to-morrow
we may reach Kasr Ruheym, the first outpost of the Euphrates
district, and there they may find supplies, but it must still be
a long distance off, if our reckoning is not altogether
incorrect.&nbsp; Wilfrid has kept a dead reckoning now ever since
we left Damascus, calculating the direction by the compass, and
the distance of each day&rsquo;s march by the pace of the camels,
and in the thousand miles we have travelled, it may well be a
little out&mdash;but according to it we should now be <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>forty-seven
miles from Meshhed Ali, which should be to the north-west, not to
the north of our present position.</p>
<p>The weather has become cold, and all day long a bitter wind
blew in our faces.&nbsp; The vegetation has changed.&nbsp; In one
place we saw some acacias, the first trees since we left
Ha&iuml;l, and some of those broom bushes which bear a flower
smelling sweet like the flower of the bean, and called here by
the Arabs, &ldquo;<i>gurrtheh</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The acacias have
given their name to the wady, Wady Hasheb (the Valley of
timber).</p>
<p>We had a good view of the berak unfurled to-day, and a
respectable-looking pilgrim, who lives, he tells us, in the
mosque of Abd-el-Kader at Bagdad, pointed out to us the motto and
device in the centre of it; the sword, he says, is the sword of
God, and under it is written &ldquo;La ilaha ila&rsquo;llahi, wa
Mohammed rasuluhu&rdquo; (There is no God but God and Mohammed is
his prophet).&nbsp; On the other side of the flag is written
&ldquo;Nasron min Allahi wa fathon kar&icirc;bon&rdquo; (Victory
is from God and success is near).</p>
<p><i>February</i> 26.&mdash;This has been a long and hard day,
over ten hours, and the whole time beating against a wind which
cut through everything, the sky darkened with sand, driving right
in our faces.&nbsp; We have however reached Kasr Ruheym, and all
our camels are still alive.&nbsp; Many of the pilgrims&rsquo;
camels, sixty or some say seventy, lay down and died on the
road.&nbsp; The beautiful thoroughbred <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>del&uacute;ls cannot stand the cold,
which is very unusual at this latitude so late in the season, and
their owners are in despair.&nbsp; All the Haj is furious with
Ambar, not the Persians only, but the Bedouin escort and the
camel owners, for his dawdling marches at first, and his forced
ones afterwards.&nbsp; In the last six days we have marched a
hundred and seventy miles, the greater part of the Haj on foot,
and almost fasting.&nbsp; What would an English army say to
that?&nbsp; Yet not one of the men&mdash;nor even of the poor
women&mdash;who have had to trudge along thus, has been left
behind.&nbsp; For ourselves we have had no extra fatigue, for the
change from camel-back to horse-back and back again is of itself
a rest.&nbsp; Khrer, my del&uacute;l, has very even paces, so
that one is not soon tired riding him.</p>
<p>We are here in clover, not actually at the Kasr, but in sight
of it, encamped at the edge of a running stream!&nbsp; The stream
rises here and is said to be perennial.&nbsp; There is a quantity
of coarse sword grass growing beside it, and everything looks
green and pretty to eyes wearied of desert scenes.&nbsp; A pair
of francolins, disturbed by the sudden invasion of their
resting-place, which they doubtless thought safely secluded from
the world, are flying backwards and forwards, put up continually
by the grazing camels, and are calling to each other from the
bushes.&nbsp; This shows that we are approaching the
Euphrates.</p>
<p>There is a village near the Kasr, about two miles from where
we are; and a good many fell&aacute;hin on <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>donkeys and
horses have arrived with provisions for sale, but they have not
brought a twentieth part of what is wanted for the Haj.&nbsp; A
cry of &ldquo;stop thief&rdquo; already announces that we have
returned to the Turkish Empire.&nbsp; It has not been heard since
we left Mez&aacute;rib.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 27.&mdash;No abatement of the wind, but less
sand.&nbsp; It appears that our acquaintances, Ali Koli Khan and
Abd er-Rahim are missing, lost in yesterday&rsquo;s storm.&nbsp;
They rode with us part of the afternoon, and then, hearing that
Ruheym was not far off, they started away on their del&uacute;ls
in front of the Haj at a trot, and of course being Persians, lost
their way, for the Persians are helpless people in the
desert.&nbsp; The sand was very thick at the time, and they must
have got out of the track.&nbsp; Ambar has sent people to look
all over the country for them, but without result.&nbsp; They
never reached Ruheym, and it is feared that they may have
perished of cold in the night.</p>
<p>This delayed the Haj from starting early, and at one time it
was given out that no move at all would be made to-day, which
would have suited us well, as there was plenty of camel pasture
at Ruheym, and two of our animals were quite at the end of their
strength.&nbsp; But at eight o&rsquo;clock the drum beat, and we
were obliged to load and be off, for now that we had entered
Turkish territory, there was danger on the road, and all must
keep together.&nbsp; Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s protection would no
longer avail.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>The
march was tedious, on account of the weariness of the camels,
though cheered by the sight of the gilt dome of Meshhed Ali,
shining like a star across the blue sea of Nejef, itself a lovely
apparition.&nbsp; The sea of Nejef (or as the Arabs call it, the
Sher&iacute;et-Ibn Haddal), is the counterpart of the Birket
el-Korn in the Egyptian Fayum, an artificial lake, formed by
cutting a canal from the Euphrates; it is about twenty miles
long, by six or seven broad.&nbsp; It is probably of Babylonian
origin, though the Arabs say it was made by an Ibn Haddal
ancestor of the present Amarrat Sheykhs, so that his camels might
have a drinking pool.&nbsp; The Ibn Haddal were, till
comparatively lately, lords of the whole of this district, and
levied tribute on Meshhed Ali and Huseyn.&nbsp; The town stands
upon the eastern shore above a fine line of limestone cliffs, and
remained in sight all day long, as we wound slowly round the
lake.&nbsp; It was a beautiful sight as far as nature was
concerned, but made horrible by the sufferings of the poor dying
camels, which now lay thick upon the road, with their unfortunate
owners, poor Bedouins perhaps with nothing else in the world,
standing beside them, luggage and bedding strewn about, which the
pilgrims were trying to carry off on their heads, seeing the
journey so nearly over.</p>
<p>Many of the camels had rushed into the lake, to drink, and
lain down there, never to get up again.&nbsp; Others could just
move one foot before the other, following at the rate of perhaps
a mile an hour, with <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>hopeless glazed eyes, and poor
emaciated bodies bare of all burden, even of the shedad.&nbsp; We
who started late because we were not ready, and had thought to
remain quiet at Ruheym, passed all these, amongst others our
friend Izzar, the Shammar boy, who was weeping over his
del&uacute;ls&mdash;two out of the three were dead.&nbsp; All
were loud in their execrations of Ambar, and one or two of Ibn
Rashid himself, whom they held responsible for part of the
delay.&nbsp; Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s government is less popular in the
desert than in the towns, especially on account of his conduct of
the Haj.&nbsp; He impresses the camels and men at a fixed rate,
ten mejidies, and gives no compensation for losses.&nbsp; They
say, however, that Ambar runs some risk of losing his head, when
all his mismanagement becomes known at Ha&iuml;l, and I confess I
think he deserves it.</p>
<p>At last we got to the <i>akabah</i>, or ascent, where the road
leads up the cliff, and here the camels lay down by scores, among
the rest our beautiful camel, Amud (the pillar), so called from
his great height.&nbsp; He was younger than the rest, except poor
Shenuan, and had been out of sorts for several days past.&nbsp; A
camel that lies down under such circumstances, seldom rises
again.&nbsp; It is not the labour, but the want of food that
kills; and unless food can be brought to the exhausted animal, he
never gets strength to rise.&nbsp; Between five and six hundred
must have perished thus to-day.</p>
<p>At the top of the <i>akabah</i> Meshhed Ali lay <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>close
before us, a long line of magnificent old walls with twelve round
towers, all of burnt brick, the only building appearing over them
being the mosque with its cupola of burnished gold, and its four
minarets.&nbsp; The whole was reddened by the afternoon sun, and
the dome looked like a sun itself.</p>
<p>Through a crowd of dirty children perched on the tombs of the
vast burying-ground which, on this side, stretches for some
distance from the walls of the city, we approached the gate of
Meshhed Ali.&nbsp; These disorderly ragamuffins shouted jeers and
rude remarks at the pilgrims, and threw stones at our dogs, and
we were glad when, turning an angle of the wall, we reached the
camping ground, a short distance from the north-eastern corner of
the city, and found ourselves at peace, with leisure to reflect
that our pilgrimage is over.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The Shrines of the Shias&mdash;Bedouin
honesty&mdash;Legend of the Tower of Babel&mdash;Bagdad&mdash;Our
party breaks up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Meshhed Ali</span> (the shrine of Ali), or
Nejef as it is more correctly called, is an ideal Eastern City,
standing as it does in an absolute desert and bare of all
surroundings but its tombs.&nbsp; It is nearly square, and the
circuit of its walls is broken by only one gate.&nbsp; These
walls are of kiln-burnt brick, and date from the time of the
Caliphs, and are still in excellent preservation.&nbsp; They are
strengthened at intervals by round towers, all very massive and
stately.&nbsp; So high are they, that they completely hide every
building inside them, with the single exception of the great
Mosque of Ali, whose glittering dome of gold shows like a rising
sun above them.</p>
<p>Inside, the houses are closely packed; but there is more
symmetry in their arrangement than in most Asiatic towns, as the
bazaar leads in a straight line from the gate to the Mosque,
which stands in the centre of the town.&nbsp; The shops are good,
or appeared so to our eyes unused to the things of cities.&nbsp;
I did <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>not myself venture far inside, as the streets were very
crowded, and we did not wish to attract unnecessary notice just
then at the time of the pilgrimage; but Wilfrid describes the
fa&ccedil;ade of the Mosque as the richest he has seen, a mass of
gold and mosaic work like some highly chased reliquary.&nbsp; He
would not go inside for fear of offending our pilgrim friends,
and left it to the rest of our party to recount the splendours of
the tomb.</p>
<p>This tomb of Ali is held by the Shias as at least as holy as
the Caaba at Mecca, and it is an article of pious belief with
them that any Moslem buried within sight of the dome is certain
of salvation.&nbsp; The consequence is that pilgrims from all
parts of the Shia world, and especially from Persia, come to
Nejef to die, and that immense numbers of corpses are sent there
for interment.&nbsp; Burial fees in fact constitute the chief
revenue of the place.</p>
<p>This city and Kerbela, where there is the sister shrine of
Huseyn, are inhabited by a number of Mahometan subjects of Her
Majesty, from India, who have settled in them from religious
motives, but remain under the protection of the British Resident
at Bagdad.&nbsp; They live on good terms with the Arabs, but do
not mix much or intermarry with them, and retain their own
language.&nbsp; As is natural in cities of pilgrimage, all
classes are ostentatiously religious, and we were amused at
listening to the devout exclamations of the blacksmith who came
to shoe our horses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ya Ali, ya Huseyn, ya Ali, ya <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Mohammed,&rdquo; at every stroke of the hammer.&nbsp;
They are all, moreover, bitterly hostile to Turkish rule, having
the double motive of national and religious antipathy to support
them.&nbsp; Both Meshhed Ali and Kerbela are kept strongly
garrisoned, but in spite of everything have constantly revolted
within the last forty years.&nbsp; When we were at Meshhed, the
Turkish Caimakam had four companies of infantry under his orders;
and the garrison of Kerbela, the head quarters of the district,
was far larger.</p>
<p>Kerbela, which lies fifty miles north of Meshhed Ali, is
physically quite unlike its rival.&nbsp; It is unfortified, and
instead of standing in the desert, is surrounded by palm gardens,
like the towns of Nejd.&nbsp; It is a richer and more populous
city than Meshhed, but to a traveller it is less interesting as
having nothing distinctive in its appearance.&nbsp; The Hiudieh
canal, which supplies it with water from the Euphrates, makes it
the centre of the most considerable agricultural district of the
Bagdad pashalik.&nbsp; Meshhed, on the other hand, has little
besides its shrine to depend on.</p>
<p>We were now very nearly at the end of our resources, both of
money, and strength, and patience; and, without more delay than
was absolutely necessary to refit our caravan, we set out for
Bagdad.&nbsp; On the evening preceding our departure, a curious
incident occurred.</p>
<p>A young Bedouin came to our tent and introduced himself as a
Shammar from the Jezireh, one of <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Faris&rsquo;s men whom we had met
the year before on the Khabur.&nbsp; He hailed the
&ldquo;Beg&rdquo; at once as brother to his master, and mentioned
the incident of the loan of ten pounds made by us to Faris.&nbsp;
This sum he offered on his own responsibility to repay us now,
and, seeing that we were rather out at elbows, he pulled out the
money from his sleeve, and almost forced it upon us.&nbsp; He had
been sent by Faris to buy a mare from the Montefyk, and had the
purchase money with him,&mdash;he knew Faris would wish him to
repay the debt.&nbsp; Though we would not take the money, the
honesty and good feeling shown greatly pleased us, and we were
glad of an opportunity to send messages to Faris, Tell&aacute;l,
and Rashid ibn Ali, who it appeared was still with the northern
Shammar.</p>
<p>This same night, too, Muttlak left us.&nbsp; It was a grief to
us to say good-bye, and he, more visibly touched even than we
were, shed tears.&nbsp; He had found, he said, men of the Amarrat
at Meshhed, who had promised to arrange his business with the
Sebaa for him, and so he would go home.&nbsp; He had come quite
two hundred miles with us, and we could not ask him to do
more.&nbsp; He had, however, something behind the reasons which
he gave us for his going; Mohammed, his cousin, had grown jealous
of his position with us, and, we have reason to suspect, made
things uncomfortable for the old Sheykh when we were not present,
in a way we could not prevent.&nbsp; Besides this, there was a
story of a blood-feud between the Ketherin and the Maadan, a
tribe which <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>lives between Nejef and Kerbela; this may have helped
to deter Muttlak from going on with us, for he is essentially a
man of peace, but there could have been no danger for him in our
company.&nbsp; Be it as it may, he came that night to dine with
us for the last time, and could eat nothing, and when we asked
him why, he said it was from sorrow, and that he must say
good-bye.&nbsp; It was evident that he spoke the truth, and I am
sure that no word of the blessings which he heaped upon our
heads, and of his promises to keep our memory green in his heart,
was more than what he felt.&nbsp; Muttlak is not a man of
words.&nbsp; Wilfrid kissed the old Sheykh, and his servant
kissed our hands, and they got on their old black del&uacute;l,
and rode quietly away the way they came, and we saw them no
more.</p>
<p>Three days of easy travelling brought us to Kerbela, for we
did not care to push on fast, and four days more to Bagdad.&nbsp;
One incident only of our route need be mentioned.&nbsp; As we
were passing the neighbourhood of Birs Nemrud, the reputed tower
of Babel, we stopped for the night at some tents belonging to the
Messaoud, a half fell&aacute;hin tribe of the left bank of the
Euphrates, where they were growing barley on some irrigated
land.&nbsp; The Sheykh, Hajji et-Teyma was away, but his son Fuaz
entertained us, and after dinner related the history of Nimrod,
the founder of the tower.&nbsp; Nimrod, he said, was an impious
man, and thought that the sun was God.&nbsp; And in order to make
war on him he built this tower, but finding <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>that he
could not reach him thus, he had a platform constructed with a
pole in the middle, and to each corner of the platform he chained
an eagle, and on the pole he hung a sheep, and the eagles wishing
to reach the sheep, flew up with the platform and Nimrod who was
standing on it.&nbsp; And when Nimrod thought himself near
enough, he shot an arrow at the sun.&nbsp; And God to punish him
destroyed the tower.&nbsp; The Yezidis worship Nimrod and Shaytan
there to this day.</p>
<p>Beyond Kerbela our road lay through cultivated land till we
reached the Euphrates, which we crossed by the bridge of boats at
Musseyib.&nbsp; Then we found ourselves among Babylonian mounds,
canals, and abandoned fields, the unvarying features of
Irak.&nbsp; These brought us at last to Bagdad, where by a
strange fatality we arrived once more in floods of rain, and
where, again, we were welcomed in the hospitable four walls of
the Residency.&nbsp; On the 6th of March we slept once more in
beds, having been without that luxury for almost three
months.</p>
<p>Here, therefore, ends our pilgrimage to Nejd, which, in spite
of some difficulties and some hardships, was accomplished
successfully without any really disagreeable incident, and here,
if we had been wise, our winter&rsquo;s adventures would have
ended too.&nbsp; We had been lucky beyond our expectations in
seeing and doing all we had proposed as the objects of our
journey, and hardly a day of the <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>eighty-four we had spent in Arabia
had been uninteresting or unromantic.&nbsp; What followed was
neither profitable nor agreeable, and might well have been left
undone.</p>
<p>At Bagdad our party necessarily broke up.&nbsp; Among the
letters awaiting us at the Consulate, was one for Mohammed ibn
Ar&ucirc;k which obliged his instant return to Tudmur.&nbsp;
Great events had occurred there in his absence, and for a moment
we felt a pang of regret at having kept him so long away from his
duties and his interests at home.&nbsp; The politics of Tudmur
are a little complicated.&nbsp; Mohammed&rsquo;s father,
Abdallah, is not the legitimate Sheykh of the town, the true head
of the Ibn Ar&ucirc;k family there being his cousin Faris.&nbsp;
Abdallah, however, has for some years past enjoyed Government
support, and is the Turkish nominee.&nbsp; The town has
consequently been divided into two factions, <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a> headed respectively by Faris and
Mohammed, the latter representing his father, who is too old for
such quarrels, and as long as the Turks were supreme at Tudmur,
Mohammed&rsquo;s party had it all their own way.&nbsp; Not,
however, that either faction wished any good to the Sultan, for
during the Russian war Mohammed was one of the foremost in
refusing the contingent demanded of the Tudmuri for the Turkish
army, but family quarrels are fierce among the Arabs, and they
take advantage of all the help they can get alike from <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>friend or
enemy.&nbsp; So Mohammed supported Turkish policy in his native
town, and was in turn supported by the Turks.&nbsp; But after the
surrender of Plevna, and the destruction of the Sultan&rsquo;s
army in the Balkans, Tudmur was abandoned to its own devices, and
Faris once more asserted his right to the sheykhat, though
parties were so evenly balanced that nothing serious for some
time occurred, and only on one occasion Faris and Mohammed
exchanged shots, without serious result.&nbsp; It was in defiance
of remonstrances on the part of his father and all his friends
that Mohammed had come with us, and the moment he was gone war
had broken out.&nbsp; A messenger, it appears, had arrived to
recall him not a week after he started with us from Damascus, and
now another letter announced that blood had been shed.&nbsp; This
was sufficient reason for our journey together coming to an end,
and Mohammed, though piously ready to accept accomplished facts
with an &ldquo;Allah kerim,&rdquo; was evidently in a hurry to be
off.&nbsp; Even if we had wished it, we could not ask him to go
further with us now.&nbsp; But we did not wish it.&nbsp; The
episode of his foolish behaviour at Ha&iuml;l, forgive it as we
would, had left a certain <i>g&ecirc;ne</i> between us, which he
was conscious of as well as ourselves, and, though he had done
much since then to atone for it, we all felt that it was best to
part.&nbsp; Still there was something mournful in his leaving us
on so forlorn an errand, and he, as Arabs do, shed tears, owning
that he had behaved in that <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>instance ungratefully to us, and
protesting his devotion.&nbsp; We on our side made him as
comfortable as we could with letters of recommendation to Valys
and Consuls, whose protection he might have need of, and with
what arms and ammunition we could spare.&nbsp; And so he and
Abdallah, and Awwad the robber, went their way on four of our
del&uacute;ls, which we gave them for the journey, and we saw
them no more.</p>
<p>We had hoped to induce Hanna to go on with us, for he in all
our difficulties had never failed us, and with his cousin the
Taw&iacute;l had helped us loyally when others had been cross or
unwilling&mdash;but Hanna was home-sick, and the Taw&iacute;l
would not desert him.&nbsp; So one day they joined a caravan of
muleteers on the point of starting for Mosul, and left us with
many tears and blessings; and the little army with which we had
crossed the desert was finally dispersed. <a

terrible accident&mdash;We travel with a holy man&mdash;Camps of
the Beni Laam&mdash;An alarm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the letters awaiting our
arrival at Bagdad, we had found an invitation from Lord and Lady
Lytton to spend the summer, or part of it, with them at
Simla.&nbsp; It seemed that this would be an opportunity, which
might never again occur, of going on to India by land, a plan
which might be made to include a visit to the Bactiari mountains,
where our acquaintance of the pilgrimage, Ali Koli Khan, had his
home.&nbsp; Ali had often talked to us of his father, and of a
wonderful stud of thoroughbred Arabians possessed by his family,
and the prospect of seeing these, and a tribe reputed to be the
most powerful in Persia, was an attraction that could not be
denied.&nbsp; He had indeed proposed to travel there <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>with us,
and introduce us himself to his people, and if circumstances had
been propitious, no doubt we might have accomplished this part of
our journey comfortably enough.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when we took
leave of the Haj at Meshhed Ali, our friend was not there for us
to concert arrangements with him, nor even to wish him
good-bye.&nbsp; He had been lost in the sandstorm, already
mentioned as having occurred on the last day but one of the
pilgrimage; and though before going on to Kerbela we had received
news of his safety, we had no opportunity of meeting him.&nbsp;
The consequence was that he neither came with us, nor gave us so
much as a letter to his father; and in the end we started alone,
a mistake we had ample reason to repent.&nbsp; The plan of
travelling from Bagdad to India by land appeared to me of
doubtful wisdom under the circumstances; but Wilfrid&rsquo;s
thirst for exploration was not yet slaked.&nbsp; He argued that
spring was just beginning, and a spring journey through Persia
must of necessity be the most delightful thing in the world, and
that we could at any moment get down to some port of the Persian
Gulf, if the weather became too hot for us.&nbsp; Our means of
transport were ready.&nbsp; We should find some difficulty in
disposing of our camels at Bagdad, and had better make use of
them; and though we were now without servants, servants might
easily be found.&nbsp; Thus, in an evil day, and without due
consideration of the difficulties and dangers which were before
us, we <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>determined to go on.&nbsp; A final circumstance decided
the matter beyond recall.&nbsp; Captain Cameron, the African
traveller, arrived at Bagdad, with the object of surveying a line
for an Indo-Mediterranean railway from Tripoli to Bushire, and
thence to the Indus, having already made the first stages of his
survey; and Wilfrid now proposed to assist him in the more
serious part of his undertaking.&nbsp; It was agreed between them
that they should take different lines from Bagdad, and meet again
either at Bushire or Bender Abbas, thus comparing notes as to the
most practicable railway line from the Tigris to the Persian
Gulf.&nbsp; Captain Cameron was to follow the left bank of the
river as far as Amara, and then to strike across the marshy
plains to Ahwas and Bender Dilam, while we should keep further
east, skirting the Hamrin and Bactiari hills.&nbsp; So presented,
the project sounded useful, if not agreeable, and acquired a
definite object, which, if it ran us into unnecessary dangers,
served also to carry us through them afterwards.&nbsp; The
expedition was accordingly a settled thing.</p>
<p>Our preparations were made, unfortunately, with as little
reflection as the decision.&nbsp; On arriving at Bagdad, we had,
as has been mentioned, said goodbye to Mohammed and the
camel-men, and had, moreover, allowed Hanna and Ibrahim, who were
homesick, or tired of travelling, to depart.&nbsp; The difficulty
now was how to replace them.&nbsp; It is always a dangerous
experiment to begin a serious journey with untried followers, and
it was our first <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>misfortune that we were obliged to do this.&nbsp;
Colonel Nixon, as he had done last year, kindly lent us a cavass;
but, alas! Ali, the intelligent fat man who had been of such
assistance to us in our Mesopotamian tour, was not fit to leave
Bagdad.&nbsp; He was lying ill of a fever, and could not be
disturbed.&nbsp; The cavass given us was consequently a stranger,
and might be good or bad, useful or useless, for anything we
knew.&nbsp; It was necessary, too, that somebody should know
Persian, and we engaged a Persian cook, Ramazan by name, highly
recommended, but equally untried.&nbsp; A young Bagdadi next
volunteered as groom, and, lastly, the Sheykh of the Agheyls, an
old friend, sent two of his men as camel-drivers.</p>
<p>None, however, of these attendants, the two last excepted, had
seen each other before, nor knew anything of our way of
travelling or our way of life.&nbsp; We did not even start
together, as it would have been wise to do.&nbsp; The country
round Bagdad is bare of pasture for many miles, and we thought to
better matters for our camels by sending them on some marches
down the river, intending to join them later with our baggage by
boat, a most unfortunate arrangement, for the men being stupid
timorous fellows, seem, when left to themselves, to have lost
their heads, and instead of obeying their orders, which were to
travel slowly, pasturing the animals as they went, drove them
without halting to the village we had named as a meeting-place,
and kept them there, half-starved in dirty stables, till we <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>came, a
piece of negligence which cost us dear.&nbsp; When we joined
them, one, the black del&uacute;l was already missing, dead they
informed us; and a second, Shayl, a camel which, when we left
Damascus, had been a model of strength and good looks, was so
reduced as to be unfit for further travelling, while the
remaining six were but a shadow of their former selves.&nbsp;
Only Hatheran, the giant leader, who had saved our fortunes in
the Nef&ucirc;d, was still fit for a full load; and to him once
more we had mainly to trust during all that was to come.</p>
<p>It is difficult for those who have never owned camels to
imagine how much attached one becomes to these animals on a long
journey, and what a variety of character they possess.&nbsp; Each
one of ours had its name, which it knew well, and its special
quality of courage, or caution, or docility.&nbsp;
Wilfrid&rsquo;s white del&uacute;l, &ldquo;Helweh&rdquo;
(sweetmeat), was gentle and obedient; the Meccan,
&ldquo;Hamra,&rdquo; thoughtless and vain; &ldquo;Ghazal,&rdquo;
affectionate, but rude and inclined to buck (poor thing, she was
far from bucking now); &ldquo;Hatheran,&rdquo; especially, was a
camel of character.&nbsp; He was evidently proud of his strength
and his superior understanding, and possessed a singular
independence of opinion which compelled respect.&nbsp; It was his
pride to march ahead of the rest, who accepted him as guide, and
followed his lead on all doubtful occasions.&nbsp; He cared
little for the beaten track, choosing his ground as seemed best
to him <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>and always for good reasons.&nbsp; He was never
impatient or put out, and in difficulties never lost his
head.&nbsp; He could carry twice the load of the others, and
could walk faster, and go longer without water.&nbsp; At the same
time, he considered himself entitled to extra rations when we
made up the evening meal, and would leave us no peace till he was
satisfied.&nbsp; I mention these things now, for feeding and
driving and tending these camels was to be our chief occupation
during the rest of our journey, and on them depended the safety
of our march, and, in great measure, of our lives.&nbsp; I say it
with no little vanity, that, starting under the unfavourable
circumstances we did, we nevertheless marched our camels without
accident five hundred miles over mountain and plain, through
swamps and streams never before traversed by camels, and across
nine large rivers, one of them bigger than the Rhine; and that we
brought them in to their journey&rsquo;s end fat and well.&nbsp;
I must not, however, forestall matters.</p>
<p>On the 20th of March, having thus sent on our camels with the
Agheyls, we embarked on board an English river steamer, with our
servants, our horses, our greyhounds, and Rasham, the falcon who
had followed our march from Ha&iuml;l, and were taken down about
eighty miles to a point of the river below Kut, where several
streams run into the Tigris from the east, thus giving the
district the name of Wudian (streams).</p>
<p>It was a cheerless start, for all down the river we <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>steamed
through driving rain, till at last the steamer was brought to,
amid the downpour, in front of a bare round bank, and we were
invited to descend.&nbsp; There was nothing but mud and a few
bushes to be seen for miles, and it seemed impossible we should
step out of the luxury of a civilised English cabin into what
seemed a mere slough, and that without means of transport further
than the bank, for of camels and men there was nothing at all to
be seen.&nbsp; But the die was cast; this was the place we had
agreed on, and, without more ado, we landed, first our horses and
then our baggage, and then ourselves.&nbsp; While this was in
operation, some Arabs had appeared on the scene, and to one of
them, an old man in a green turban, Captain Clements, before he
said good-bye, confided us.&nbsp; Seyd Abbas, he told us, was an
old acquaintance, and an honest man; and though the rest, it was
easy to see, were of the lowest order of fell&aacute;hin Arabs,
we were fain to be content with this assurance and make what
friends we could, at least with the old man.&nbsp; Sitting
disconsolately on our camel bags in the rain, we then made our
last farewell to all on board, and having watched the steamer
till it steamed out of sight, set ourselves in earnest to the
work that was before us. <a name="citation119"></a><a
href="#footnote119" class="citation">[119]</a>&nbsp; I resume my
journal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tent was soon rigged up on a piece of <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>sounder
ground than the rest, and the horses fettered and turned out to
graze.&nbsp; My new mare, Canora, so called after the Canora or
Nebbuk tree which grows in the Residency yard, is certainly a
great beauty, and attracts much, too much, attention, from the
rather thievish-looking people of this place.&nbsp; Wilfrid has
been to the encampment, which is about half a mile off, with Seyd
Abbas, and has made friends with their chief people, but he has
no agreeable impression of those he has seen.&nbsp; They appear
to be, he says, a mixed collection of fell&aacute;hin from all
the Iraki tribes, and can lay no claim at all to good
birth.&nbsp; Their Sheykh alone, for Seyd Abbas is not their
Sheykh, claims gentility as coming from the Beni Laam, but we do
not like his looks.&nbsp; The Beni Laam, Seyd Abbas tells us, are
three days&rsquo; journey from here, and there is war going on
amongst them just now, owing to a quarrel between their Sheykh,
Mizban, and one of his brothers.&nbsp; He gives rather a terrible
picture of them, and has been trying to dissuade us from going
further; but we think that with the letters we have for Mizban,
there can be no difficulty.&nbsp; The Beni Laam are, at any rate,
a true Bedouin tribe, not fell&aacute;hin, like the people
here.&nbsp; Old Hajji Mohammed (the cavass) stayed with me while
Wilfrid was away.&nbsp; He was once in the army, and insisted on
standing sentry in the rain in spite of all I could do to make
him sit down under the flap of the tent.&nbsp; He has evidently
small confidence in the people here.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Some
fowls have been brought from the camp, and there are sticks
enough to make a fire.&nbsp; Now we shall see what our Persian
cook can do.&nbsp; If the camels were here, our being detained
would not so much matter.&nbsp; We heard of them at Kut as we
passed by in the steamer, but that is twenty-five miles off; and
with this rain it is impossible to say when they may arrive.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 22.&mdash;The weather has cleared, and we can see
the Hamrin hills to the east, not so very far off.&nbsp; The
country is less hideous than it seemed yesterday in the
rain.&nbsp; This place is a sort of peninsula or island, formed
by two rivers, which come from the Hamrin hills and fall into the
Tigris.&nbsp; These seemed to be joined higher up by a canal, so
that the space inside is cut off from the desert.&nbsp; It is
partly a swamp, partly a thicket of guttub bushes, with here and
there patches of cultivation made by fell&aacute;hin.&nbsp; These
call themselves Saadeh, but Seyd Abbas says they come from all
parts.&nbsp; He himself is brother to the Sheykh of Ali Ghurbi, a
village on the other side of the Tigris.&nbsp; There are no
villages at all on this side after Kut, and this island of Wudian
is the only inhabited spot.&nbsp; The fell&aacute;hin are very
poor, and complain bitterly of the government, which ruins
them.&nbsp; They are completely under the thumb of the Turks, now
that the government has steamers on the river, and the
tax-gatherers take (if we may believe them), about two-thirds of
their crops.&nbsp; They have also to pay ten beshliks (francs) <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>for each
tent, half a beshlik for each sheep, two beshliks for each
buffalo they keep, and a capitation tax of two and a half
beshliks besides.&nbsp; Moreover, they are visited now and then
by zaptiehs, who take their horses from them if they do not
manage to hide them away, on the pretence that they cannot afford
to keep them, while Mizban makes them pay tribute for protection
too, or rather for the right of being left alone.&nbsp; The
government does absolutely nothing in return for what it
takes.&nbsp; They are indeed in a wretched plight, and one
wonders why they take all this trouble of cultivation for so
little, but perhaps it is a choice between that and
starvation.</p>
<p>The great feature of Wudian is its wild-boars.&nbsp; These
literally swarm in the fields, trotting about in open day-light,
and doing exactly as they like.&nbsp; The people are afraid of
them, and keep out of their way, and no wonder, for they are
gigantic beasts.&nbsp; A man who was at our tents to-day, shewed
us a terrible wound he had received from one which charged him
quite without provocation.&nbsp; The people have only their short
spears to protect themselves with.&nbsp; The beasts come almost
inside the camp, and Wilfrid found one this afternoon fast asleep
under a bush, within ten yards of the path which leads to the
tents.&nbsp; The people passing along, went a long way round so
as not to disturb it, for it lay quite exposed to view.&nbsp;
Seyd Abbas begged him to destroy some of them, and Wilfrid has
ridden out on Ariel, and taken the Winchester rifle to see what
he <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>can
do.&nbsp; I have felt feverish, and have stayed at home drying
the things which had got wet.</p>
<p>The people here are all Shias, and very fanatical, and Seyd
Abbas as a descendant of the Prophet enjoys a high position among
them.&nbsp; Among the &Aacute;nazeh and Shammar, the Bedouins
think nothing of saints and seyyids, but here they have everybody
at their feet.&nbsp; Bashaga, the Sheykh, though a Beni Laam and,
as such, a &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; is not nearly so important as
the old man in the green turban.&nbsp; The latter has been
talking to me this morning and promises to take us to
Mizban&rsquo;s camp, if we insist on going, though he advises
strongly not.&nbsp; He says that with him we shall be safe, as
they also have a great respect for Seyyids, and besides he has
married into Mizban&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Seyyid or not, he eats
and drinks with us freely; so we feel a certain amount of
confidence in him.</p>
<p>Wilfrid has returned triumphant.&nbsp; He was not more than
two hours and a half away, and he has killed five boars and a
sow.&nbsp; Ariel behaved wonderfully, following the pigs without
any need of urging, and without flinching when they
charged.&nbsp; It seems to have been splendid sport.&nbsp;
Amongst the victims was the old boar that had been seen asleep,
and which charged most viciously.&nbsp; It is lucky the dogs were
not taken, as they would certainly have got hurt.&nbsp; The Arabs
are highly delighted at the result, and we hope it may put us on
better terms with them.&nbsp; They have dragged one of the
corpses, <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>a disgusting object, to the bank of the river,
intending, they say, to send it to the British Resident at Bagdad
by the next steamer.&nbsp; No news, alas, of the camels.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 23.&mdash;A fearful storm in the night, and the
whole place under water.&nbsp; Wilfrid went out early to try and
get news of the camels, riding Job, the grey horse we bought of
Col. Nixon.&nbsp; He did not get far, for the streams are so
swollen that they are impassable, at least for one who does not
know the fords; and Job is a rather timid horse to get into
difficulties with.&nbsp; He is young, and fairly bolted when a
pig jumped up from out of a bush near him.&nbsp; We are both
going out now for some more boar-hunting.&nbsp; I should enjoy it
better if I was sure we should ever get away from this swampy
place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>We have had a great misfortune.&nbsp; Ariel is badly
wounded.&nbsp; We went out to-day, a large party, people on foot
with spears and hoes, and one or two on sorry little mares.&nbsp;
It was a beautiful day after the rain, birds singing in all the
bushes, francolins calling, hoopoes flying about, and woodcocks
starting from guttub thickets.&nbsp; The island was half under
water, and droves of pigs, boars, sows and little ones, turned
out of the bushes, where they generally lie in the day-time, were
grunting and trotting and splashing about everywhere.&nbsp; We
singled out a great red boar, and all gave chase, but the ground
was heavier than yesterday, and we had a longish <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>gallop to
come up to him.&nbsp; It was difficult, too, to keep to the boar
we had chosen, where there were so many.&nbsp; At last he
charged, and was hit, but not enough to stop though it turned
him, and then we had another gallop, and another shot rolled him
over.&nbsp; The people on foot, who were following them, rushed
in, but just as they got near him up he jumped, and bolted
towards some deep water, where there was a high guttub
bush.&nbsp; I was in front, and Wilfrid shouted to me to turn
him, which I would have done if I could, but instead, he turned
me, coming at me with a savage grunt and a toss of his head which
I knew was dangerous.&nbsp; Then he plunged into the deep water,
but instead of going on, suddenly changed his mind, and came back
to where the bush was on the land, and before we were aware, had
charged right in among us.&nbsp; Wilfrid turned his mare, but,
alas, not fast enough, firing as he turned.&nbsp; To my horror, I
saw the hideous beast catch Ariel and give her a toss, such as I
have seen in the bull-ring given by a bull.&nbsp; He seemed to
lift horse and rider clean off the ground.&nbsp; Ariel staggered
away, while the boar lay down, and was soon after dispatched by
the Arabs.</p>
<p>We meanwhile had torn off our kefiyehs and scarfs, and were
trying to staunch a ghastly wound in the poor mare&rsquo;s
leg.&nbsp; The leg was ripped up inside from the hock to the
stifle, and an artery had been cut.&nbsp; For a long while it was
all in vain.&nbsp; We could not stop the flow, and no words can
describe our misery as we watched the blood pouring <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>fast upon
the ground.&nbsp; We were in despair, for besides the fact of her
being thus precious in race, we are much attached to the mare for
her own sake, as who would not be, for Ariel is the noblest and
best and gentlest creature that ever was.&nbsp; She has a
pathetic look in her eyes, and is absolutely patient under her
suffering.&nbsp; We have now some hope of her recovery, but
Wilfrid fears she must be abandoned, for the sinew is cut bare,
and she cannot put her foot to the ground.</p>
<p>While we were engaged in tending her, suddenly the camels
appeared.&nbsp; It would have given us immense pleasure a few
hours ago.&nbsp; Now all seemed indifferent.&nbsp; Their
presence, however, enabled us to bring our camp here, where the
mare is.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 24.&mdash;This certainly is an ill-starred
journey.&nbsp; The stupid Agheyls have so neglected our camels
that Abdeh is dead, and Shayl unable to go further.&nbsp; Nor are
the rest in much better case.&nbsp; We had some discussion this
morning about giving up our present plan, and taking the next
steamer which passes by for Bussora where we could make a fresh
start.&nbsp; This would have been the best chance of saving the
mare.&nbsp; But we decided to push on, and accordingly we left
Wudian this morning, fording the canal, which is about four feet
deep, fortunately without accident, and marching slowly in a
south-east direction across a perfectly level plain.&nbsp; Ours
is a melancholy caravan, for poor Ariel walks with great
difficulty, her leg being terribly swollen; but <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>she has
such courage that we hope she may yet pull through.&nbsp; It was
a choice of evils, bringing or leaving her; for leaving her would
mean that we should never see her again.&nbsp; Bashaga could not
be trusted with her, nor any of the Arabs of Wudian except Seyd
Abbas, and he has come with us.&nbsp; Seyd Abbas is mounted on a
sorry little white kadish, and his son Hassan, who has come too,
marches on foot.&nbsp; Wilfrid is mounted now on Job, and Hajji
Mohammed on the hamra.&nbsp; Thus we have travelled about ten
miles.&nbsp; The plain is here for the most part absolutely bare
alluvial soil, like that of Irak, but mixed with saltpetre, and
so producing nothing.&nbsp; Here and there, however, there is a
swamp, with a little show of verdure, and we have encamped in the
middle of a patch of thistles, the first bit of pasture we have
come to.&nbsp; We have met no one, but there are some tents now
at a distance, with camels feeding, supposed to belong to the
Beni Laam.&nbsp; Hajji Mohammed has been to the tents, but he
does not seem to know how to manage among the Bedouins, and has
come back empty-handed, declaring that the owners were rude to
him.&nbsp; We ought, I suppose, to have gone ourselves, but we
are in such distress about the mare that we do not like to leave
her.&nbsp; We have been dressing her wounds with Holloway&rsquo;s
ointment, as she lies on her side at our tent door.&nbsp; The
thistles are of the spotted sort, and all the animals, including
Ariel, seem to enjoy them.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 25.&mdash;We hoped that Ariel was better, <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>she had
eaten well over-night, and though very stiff this morning, was
able to start with us; but after travelling a couple of miles,
she staggered and fell down, and though she got up again, she
again fell.&nbsp; The third time she refused to move, the pain
being too great, and there she lay on her side as if dead.&nbsp;
It was useless to try to bring her further, and as we happened to
be passing within half a mile of the tents we had seen yesterday,
it was agreed that Hassan, Seyd Abbas&rsquo; son, should stop
with her and get her gradually to them, and so back to
Wudian.&nbsp; We have promised him a handsome reward if he
succeeds in recovering her and sending her back to Bagdad, and he
has protested he will do everything he can.&nbsp; All the same, I
do not doubt that we have bid good-bye to Ariel for ever.&nbsp;
She lifted up her beautiful head as we took leave of her, and
seemed to understand what was happening, for Arab horses
understand things as people do.&nbsp; Wilfrid brought her a
bucket of water, which she drank, and then she laid her head upon
the ground again, and we went away. <a name="citation128"></a><a
href="#footnote128" class="citation">[128]</a></p>
<p>Travelling without her to-day has seemed unnatural.&nbsp; It
is impossible to enjoy looking at the sunshine or the Hamrin
hills, though these have been <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>very beautiful.&nbsp; We are again
encamped in the open plain not ten miles from these hills, and
three or four perhaps from the river, which we have been marching
almost parallel with.</p>
<p>A new complication has arisen in the behaviour of Ramazan, the
cook, who has proved so insubordinate that he is to be sent about
his business.&nbsp; Seyd Abbas is to go to-morrow to Ali Ghurbi
on the river, to make purchases of rice and dates for us, and he
will take Ramazan with him, as also the groom, who declares he
has got fever, caught in the Wudian swamps, and will go no
further.&nbsp; Thus our party is melting away at the outset; but
we are in the meanwhile to go on, with a young man Seyd Abbas
brought with him from last night&rsquo;s tents, to a large camp
of the Beni Laam, which is said to be just under the hills, and
wait there till the Seyyid joins us.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 26.&mdash;Four hours&rsquo; march has brought us
to the hills.&nbsp; As we got near them, we found the usual signs
of a Bedouin encampment, distant flocks of sheep and then
shepherds, all moving with that exaggerated, mysterious
appearance of speed the mirage gives.&nbsp; We galloped on to
reconnoitre from a tall tell in front of us, and soon made out
the camp.&nbsp; There was a stream of water just below, and the
tell and the plain near it were covered with something like turf,
while the hill sides were visibly green with grass.&nbsp; A
shepherd told us that the camp was Musa&rsquo;s, the sheykh we <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>were in
search of; and, waiting till the camels came up with us, we went
on there.</p>
<p>Musa ibn Sollal was absent, and we were directed to his
brother Akul&rsquo;s tent.&nbsp; We found him fast asleep in a
corner of the tent, but he woke up when we entered, and received
us politely.&nbsp; He told us that the Sheykh had gone to Amara,
at a summons from the mutesserif of that town, to meet his
brother Mizban, and have their quarrel made up.&nbsp; It seems
that Musa, Akul and Homeydi, all sons of one mother, are making
war against their half-brother, Mizban, who is head of the Ibn
Sollal family, as well as principal Sheykh of all the Beni Laam;
and the quarrel is now a serious affair, for Mizban has killed
one of Musa&rsquo;s sons.&nbsp; There can be little chance of its
being patched up by Turkish intervention, for the present
mutesserif is weak &ldquo;like a lady,&rdquo; they say, and not
at all the man to deal with a blood-feud.</p>
<p>Akul is an elderly man, with a grey beard, and devoted to
children.&nbsp; He has been doing his best to entertain us, as
well as to amuse a little group of small children who came
clustering around him when he awoke.&nbsp; His tent is a poor
one, small and hot like a stewpan; and we escaped from it the
moment we could with propriety go to our own, pitched only a few
yards off&mdash;too few, alas! for comfort, for the people here,
though well-behaved, cannot resist their curiosity to
&ldquo;farraj.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These Beni Laam must be counted as true <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Bedouins,
as none of them are fell&aacute;hin, or would lift a finger to
till the ground, for which purpose they employ such low tribes as
our friends the Saadeh and the Abiad.&nbsp; But they are quite
different from any other true Bedouins I have visited, not only
in manners but in looks; and there seems to be among them a great
mixture of races.&nbsp; Seyd Abbas has told us that they
intermarry with Persian and Kurdish tribes, and that they also
receive and adopt into their own tribe vagabonds from no one
knows where; and this account is fully borne out by their
appearance.&nbsp; Mixed descent may be read in their faces.&nbsp;
Neither do they, as far as I can make out, lay much claim to good
breeding, except in the ruling family, Ibn Sollal, which is proud
of its ancestry in the male line.&nbsp; Akul and his brother
Homeydi, who visited us in the evening, talked a great deal about
their Nejdean descent.&nbsp; According to their own account they
(the Ibn Sollal) came from Nejd twelve generations ago and I do
not doubt the correctness of the tradition; but their Arabian
blood has since become so much diluted with foreign additions,
that in Nejd itself they would not be accepted as nobly
born.&nbsp; They do not deny their marriages with the daughters
of the neighbouring lands, but seem to think it a matter of no
consequence.&nbsp; They will even marry with townspeople and
Bagdadis; and we heard on board the steamer of a relative of
Mizban&rsquo;s married to a certain Jazin Sabunji, a tradesman in
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Bagdad.&nbsp; His brother, Ahmet Sabunji, had, on the
strength of the connection, given us a letter to add to our
packet of introductions to Mizban.</p>
<p>The horses here seem to be of small account.&nbsp; Fifteen or
twenty mare&rsquo;s, wearing the usual iron shackles, are grazing
about a mile off, some with foals by their sides, all standing in
water above their fetlocks.&nbsp; We walked round to examine
them, and saw one good-looking white mare that may be
thoroughbred, and also a bay somewhat better than the rest, but
they are inferior animals.&nbsp; A foal was born last night, and
was being removed with its mother, a wretched little creature, to
the dry ground at the camp.&nbsp; There were no camels to be
seen.&nbsp; They and the sheep are at pasture at a considerable
distance.</p>
<p>A couple of Bagdad sheep-dealers have come by with a large
flock just purchased from Mizban&rsquo;s people.&nbsp; Their
description is glowing of the wealth and grandeur, and excellent
reception to be met with at the great Sheykh&rsquo;s tents.&nbsp;
They are travelling quietly, and apparently without precaution or
fear of being attacked by the ghaz&uacute;s, so much talked
about.&nbsp; But I suppose they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Several women came to see me, accompanied by some children,
two or three of whom were really beautiful, one little boy
especially.&nbsp; Their visit soon attracted a crowd, for
everybody who passed stopped to join the circle in front of our
tent.&nbsp; They were good-humoured and rather encroaching and
forward, <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>but kept in check by a middle-aged man with a big
stick, who undertook the office of master of the
ceremonies.&nbsp; His method was rough and ready; every now and
then to effect a complete dispersion of the party by rushing into
the midst of them and dealing out blows on every side without
distinction of age or sex.&nbsp; The visitors then ran away in
all directions laughing, and almost immediately returned more gay
and merry than before.&nbsp; One young lady, Basha by name,
proposed to accompany us on our journey, and my answer,
&ldquo;Marhaba, fetch your mare and come,&rdquo; brought down on
her endless chaff.</p>
<p>A few small presents have made Musa very amiable, and he has
sent us a guard for our tents.&nbsp; There is, it would seem,
some apprehension of attack on the part of the hostile section of
the tribe who are not far off, and a ghaz&uacute; from Mizban is
much talked of.&nbsp; So the conference of the two brothers at
Amara does not prevent their followers from carrying on the
war.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 27.&mdash;Nothing worse happened during the night
than a thunderstorm.&nbsp; Wilfrid started early on Job to try
and find old Seyd Abbas, of whom nothing was heard
yesterday.&nbsp; He went alone, and cantered for about ten miles
in the direction of the river, but finding a large marsh between
him and it, and, moreover, that Ali Ghurbi was beyond the river,
he returned.&nbsp; He met, he tells me, a number of Arabs whom he
believes to have been Mizban&rsquo;s people.&nbsp; They made some
show of trying to <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>circumvent him, but were too ill-mounted to be
dangerous.&nbsp; At midday the Seyyid arrived with two donkey
loads of provisions from the village.&nbsp; We had all but given
him up for lost, and in our dearth of friends, we now begin to
feel something like affection for him, seeing him return.</p>
<p>We have made so little progress this week that we could not
consent to stay another night with Musa, and have come on, in
spite of tempestuous skies and alarming rumours of a
ghaz&uacute;, which is said to be on the march from
Mizban&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We have, however, hitherto, escaped all
these dangers.&nbsp; The thunderstorms, though rattling like
artillery, right, left, in front, and behind us, spared us
overhead; and we have seen no living soul all the
afternoon.&nbsp; It is a wild, strange piece of country, but
covered in places with excellent pasture, so that we have the
satisfaction of seeing our dear camels growing fat beneath our
eyes.&nbsp; We have stopped for the night at the edge of an
enormous red morass, the haunt of innumerable birds.&nbsp; There
are two little tells close by, and a pool of rain water good to
drink.&nbsp; We have now left the neighbourhood of the Tigris for
good, so that these swamps have nothing to do with it.&nbsp; They
seem to be caused by small streams running from the Hamrin Hills,
and caught in this great flat plain.&nbsp; The railway, in
Wilfrid&rsquo;s opinion, if it is ever made, ought to run along
the foot of the hills where the ground is sounder.&nbsp; It is
difficult, however, to <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>imagine the use of a railway in such
an uninhabited country.</p>
<p>The tells where we are, are called Doheyleh; but there is
nothing in the shape of a village anywhere this side the Tigris,
nor are there any Bedouins except these Beni Laam.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 28.&mdash;A good morning&rsquo;s march has
brought us safely to Mizban&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It seems that after
all we ran some danger last night, for a ghaz&uacute; was really
out between the two Beni Laam camps, and we find Mizban&rsquo;s
people in commotion.&nbsp; A few miles from the camp we were met
by a body of horsemen advancing in open order, who, as soon as
they saw us, galloped at full speed towards us, and seemed as if
intending to attack.&nbsp; But Seyd Abbas rode forward to meet
them on his old grey kadish and waved his cloak and shouted to
them to stop.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;Seyd
Abbas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the horsemen pulled up, and
dismounting, kissed the old man&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; They were a
ghaz&uacute;, they told us, from Lazim, Mizban&rsquo;s eldest
son, and they were following on the track of some robbers from
Musa&rsquo;s, who had carried off seventeen camels in the
night.&nbsp; They cross-questioned Seyd Abbas as to Musa&rsquo;s
whereabouts, but the old man would not let out the secret.&nbsp;
It would have been a breach of the hospitality he had just
received from Musa.&nbsp; They did not stop long, however, to
talk, but went on their way, leaving a couple of the party only
to show us to Mizban&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>The
tents of the Beni Laam are peculiar.&nbsp; Instead of being, like
every other Arab tent we have seen, set on a number of poles each
of different height, these are shaped like regular pent-houses,
with gable roof and walls.&nbsp; Such, at least, is
Mizban&rsquo;s <i>mud&iacute;f</i>, a construction corresponding
with the <i>kahwah</i> of a town house, and used only for
reception.&nbsp; The living tents are smaller, and the word
<i>beyt</i> house here applies only to the harim.&nbsp; The
mud&iacute;f is a fine airy room, very pleasant in the hot
weather we are beginning to have.&nbsp; It is pitched close to
the river Tibb in the middle of a very large camp, several
hundred tents, and looks imposing enough.&nbsp; The country all
round is very bare and trodden down, having been exposed last
night to a fearful hail storm, which has wrecked all the
vegetation.&nbsp; The hailstones, they say, were as big as
dates.</p>
<p>The Tibb is much swollen, and flowing through a deep cutting,
looks anything but easy to cross,&mdash;a turbid yellow river
cutting its way through the alluvial plain without valley of any
sort, so that you do not know it is there until you come close to
it.&nbsp; It is about fifty yards wide.</p>
<p>At the door of the mud&iacute;f we alighted, and presently
made the acquaintance of our host&mdash;not Mizban, for he, as we
heard before, is away at Amara, but his son Beneyeh&mdash;a
rather handsome but not quite agreeable looking youth, whose
forward, almost rude manners show him to be, what he no doubt is,
a spoilt child.&nbsp; We have been <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>rather reserved with him in
consequence, and have left to Hajji Mohammed the task of
explaining our name and quality, and delivering the letters which
we have with us for his father.&nbsp; Beneyeh is not the eldest
son, and I do not quite understand why he does the honours of his
father&rsquo;s tent instead of Lazim.&nbsp; It is difficult to
know exactly how to treat him; but we think it better to be on
the side of politeness, so we have sent him the cloak intended
for the Sheykh, and have added to it a revolver, with which he
seems pleased.&nbsp; We are so completely in his hands for our
further progress, that we must do what we can to secure his good
will.&nbsp; I have paid a visit to the harim, and have been well
received by Beneyeh&rsquo;s mother, Yeddi, a fat jovial person,
young-looking for her age.&nbsp; She is very proud of her son,
and the evident cause of his spoiling.&nbsp; Her stepdaughter
Hukma, and daughter-in-law Rasi, are both rather pretty; though
the latter, like the mother-in-law, shows signs of foreign blood,
being inclined to fat, and being red-haired and fair
complexioned.&nbsp; The occasion of my visit to them was a
distressing one.&nbsp; We had hardly retired to our own tent when
a loud explosion was heard, and immediately afterwards a man came
running to us to beg us to come, for an accident had
happened.&nbsp; In the storm last night some gunpowder belonging
to Beneyeh had got wet, and a slave had been set to dry it at the
fire in the women&rsquo;s tent, with the result of a blow up and
fearful burning of the unfortunate creature.&nbsp; They <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>wanted us,
of course, to cure him; and we gave what advice we could, but
with little chance of success.&nbsp; The poor slave lay groaning
there behind a matting all the time I was in the tent, but Yeddi
and the rest chattered, and laughed, and screamed, regardless as
children.&nbsp; Sick people get little peace in the Desert.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Wilfrid believes he has arranged matters with Beneyeh, who
came to dine with us this evening, and talked matters over
afterwards with Seyd Abbas.&nbsp; He declared at first that a
journey across the frontier into Persia was out of the question,
that nobody had ever been that way, that the Beni Laam were at
war with the Ajjem (Persians) and could not venture into the
neighbourhood of Dizful, or any town of Persia, and that his
father was away, and he had no men to spare as escort.&nbsp;
After much talking, however, and persuasion on the Seyyid&rsquo;s
part, he has agreed to start with us to-morrow with thirty
horsemen and see us safely to the camp of one Kerim Khan, chief
of a Kurdish tribe, which lives on the river Karkeria, beyond
which Persia proper begins, and that he will take &pound;10 for
his trouble.&nbsp; The sum is hardly excessive if he fulfils his
part of the bargain, for the country between Turkey and Persia
has the reputation of being quite impracticable, not only from
the robber bands which inhabit it, but from the rivers which must
be crossed.&nbsp; Hajji Mohammed is very gloomy about the whole
matter.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>In
the middle of our conversation a fearful hubbub arose in the camp
round, followed by some shots and the galloping of horses, and
Beneyeh exclaiming, &ldquo;A ghaz&uacute;, a ghaz&uacute;!&rdquo;
jumped up and rushed out of the tent.&nbsp; Our first thought was
to put out the candle, and our second to stand to our arms and
look outside.&nbsp; In the dim starlight we could see what seemed
to be a fight going on inside and round the mud&iacute;f; and
though night attacks are very unusual in the desert, we were
convinced an enemy was sacking the camp.&nbsp; Though the quarrel
was no affair of ours, and we should probably be in little danger
had it been daylight, now in the darkness we could not help
feeling alarmed.&nbsp; Wilfrid served out cartridges, and gave
the order that all should kneel down so as to be prepared for
action if the tide of battle should come our way, an arrangement
which resulted only in Hajji Mohammed&rsquo;s letting off his gun
by accident, and very nearly shooting one of the Agheyls.&nbsp;
The mares had their iron fetters on, and with the keys in our
pockets we knew they could not be lost.&nbsp; Still it was an
anxious moment.&nbsp; At the end of a quarter of an hour,
however, Beneyeh came back in great excitement to say that a
ghaz&uacute; had come from Musa&rsquo;s, and that some camels had
been driven away; that the hubbub in the tent was not fighting,
but preparation to fight; and that he was come to borrow a rifle
as he and his friends were starting in pursuit.&nbsp; Wilfrid
gave him one of the guns and offered to ride with him on <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>his
expedition, but Seyd Abbas, who had all the time been cheering us
with an assurance that &ldquo;it was not our affair,&rdquo; would
not hear of this; and, after a long discussion, it was decided
that we should all stay together, as indeed is only
prudent.&nbsp; I do not believe the ghaz&uacute; has been
anything very serious; for, though Beneyeh and some of his men
have galloped off in the supposed direction of the enemy, by far
the greater number have remained, preferring shouting and singing
to actual fighting.&nbsp; They are now chaunting in chorus
&ldquo;Aduan&mdash;Mizban
(enemies&mdash;Mizban)&mdash;Aduan&mdash;Mizban,&rdquo; and
striking their spears on the ground to beat time.&nbsp; A great
fire has been lit and is blazing in the mud&iacute;f, and the
dark figures passing and repassing in front of it make the whole
thing wild and savage in the extreme.</p>

robbers&mdash;Ghafil and Saadun&mdash;We diplomatise&mdash;A
march across &ldquo;No-man&rsquo;s-land&rdquo;&mdash;Night
terrors&mdash;We claim protection of a Persian prince.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 29.&mdash;The event of last night, though in
truth it was less alarming than it seemed, made us anxious not to
remain longer at Mizban&rsquo;s than could be helped.&nbsp;
Wilfrid accordingly no sooner saw Beneyeh this morning, than he
began to urge our departure on him, as it had been arranged
over-night.&nbsp; The young man was in a bad humour, his pursuit
of the ghaz&uacute; having been either unsuccessful, or, as we
suspect, never seriously made; and at first he would hear of
nothing but that we should go back to Amara, instead of crossing
the frontier, which he again declared to be impracticable.&nbsp;
He was put out, moreover, because we did not allow him to keep
the gun which he had borrowed in the night; and but for old Seyd
Abbas, whom he is bound to treat with respect, I doubt if he
would have kept to his bargain with us.&nbsp; I begin <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>to regret
now that he at last allowed himself to be persuaded, for we seem
to have got into a very awkward pass.</p>
<p>Our troubles to-day began early.&nbsp; First of all we had to
say farewell to Seyd Abbas, our last connecting link with
respectability.&nbsp; The old man said he dared not go further;
that in the country where we were going his condition as a seyyid
would not be respected, nor could he do more for us than wish us
well through it.&nbsp; He washed his hands, in fact, of the whole
proceeding, and protested that he had gone farther than he ought
in bringing us thus far.&nbsp; We could not indeed find fault
with him for wishing to return, and thanking him heartily for
all, and so recommending him once more to see to Ariel, we let
him go.&nbsp; Since then all has gone wrong.&nbsp; We had first
the river to cross, a not very easy proceeding, for the banks
were of mud, and the water up to our horses&rsquo;
shoulders.&nbsp; Still, nothing untoward happened till we had all
got over.&nbsp; Then the two Agheyls, our camel-drivers, declared
that they too would go no further.&nbsp; The journey into Persia
frightened them, they said, as well as Seyd Abbas, and though
they gave a variety of reasons besides, it always came back to
this, that they did not like to die in a foreign land.&nbsp; It
was no use arguing with them that they should not die, and that
we would provide handsomely for their return to Bagdad by sea; no
offers could move them, nor even the threat of their
Sheykh&rsquo;s displeasure, which we held <i>in terrorem</i> <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>over
them.&nbsp; It was impossible to be really angry, yet our case is
a forlorn one without them.&nbsp; To-day we and Hajji Mohammed
have had to load and drive the camels ourselves, for he is the
only servant left us, and Beneyeh and his Arabs would do nothing,
contenting themselves with galloping about and shouting out their
unasked-for advice.&nbsp; It was very annoying.</p>
<p>Beneyeh&rsquo;s manner has changed alarmingly.&nbsp; Finding
us practically in his power, now we have crossed the Tibb and
cannot retreat, he has become most insolent, trying all day to
pick a quarrel with us about the revolver we gave him, and which
he has put out of order by his clumsiness, and asking for one
thing and another belonging to us exactly like a rude, ill-bred
child.&nbsp; Wilfrid was obliged to speak sharply to him and bid
him be ashamed of himself, as his manners are those of an Iraki
fellah, not of a Sheykh&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Still he went on, now
asking for Wilfrid&rsquo;s sword, now proposing to buy my mare,
impertinences both, till, on being told he was a fool, he rode on
in a huff with his men.&nbsp; There were nine of them, and one
only remained with us, an older man who seemed ashamed of his
young chief, and with whom we got on more pleasantly.&nbsp; Still
it is a disagreeable prospect to have to travel with such rascals
all the way to Persia.&nbsp; The party are tolerably mounted, the
Beni Laam having a few asil mares, principally of the Wadnan
breed, and at Mizban&rsquo;s <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>camp there was a horse which they
called a Nusban, a name new to us.</p>
<p>The country, after passing the Tibb, is a fine rolling down,
with capital pasture in the hollows, so that to our other
difficulties we are fortunately spared that of anxiety about our
camels.&nbsp; It is worth something to see them feeding on rich
green grass as they go, making up at last for their long
winter&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock we sighted some tents, where we found
Beneyeh with his men, waiting for a dinner of lamb which was
being prepared.&nbsp; Hungry as we were, we should have much
preferred passing on unfeasted, for we are now suspicious of our
host, and feel anxious when away from our horses.&nbsp; Still
there was no refusing, or seeming to doubt or be afraid, and we
joined with as good a grace as we could in the rather rude
entertainment.&nbsp; The meal lasted upwards of an hour, and when
we were ready to start there were still delays, so that it was
dark before we reached the camp which was to be our resting-place
for the night.&nbsp; The late rains have put much of the
low-lying country under water, and we are now in a broad valley,
formerly, one may guess, a rich agricultural district, but long
deserted.&nbsp; We passed about sunset the mounds of an ancient
city, which are not marked on any of our maps, and which the
people here call Jer&eacute;ysiat; and near these we came upon
the camp where we now are.</p>
<p>What its inhabitants are we do not yet know.&nbsp; <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>Dakher, the
chief man, is, it would seem, a Beni Laam, but the rest have more
the appearance of outlaws than of respectable Bedouins.&nbsp;
They have the most evil countenances of any people we have met on
any of our travels, and Hajji Mohammed says roundly they are
Kurdish robbers.&nbsp; Dakher and his brother Ghafil look capable
of any treachery.&nbsp; They have a soft manner, with great
flabby faces, and a black look in their eyes, which, with their
rows of glittering white teeth, give one a shudder.&nbsp; They
received us at first with some show of hospitality in their
&ldquo;mud&iacute;f,&rdquo; which was a large one; but though a
fire of logs was blazing in the middle, and pots were standing
round, nobody gave us coffee, a very disagreeable omen; and when
I asked just now for water, they would not bring it me in one of
their own pans, but took ours.&nbsp; They are Shias, probably,
and rude on principle.&nbsp; We have pitched our tent the best
way we could in the dark, and piled up all our luggage inside,
for every man here looks like a thief&mdash;I might say like a
murderer.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 30.&mdash;Last night, before we lay down to
sleep, Beneyeh came to our tent with Dakher, and began bullying
again and begging, but Wilfrid would give him nothing except the
sum of &pound;10 agreed on, for which he promised, and Dakher
promised, that thirty khayal should go on with us to Dizful, a
distance of about ninety miles.&nbsp; Beneyeh himself refused to
go, saying that Ajjem (Persia) was not <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>his
country, but Dakher should go for him, or Ghafil.&nbsp; This was
a distinct breach of agreement, but we were only too pleased to
get rid of him, and Wilfrid, after some show of expostulation,
accepted the substitute.&nbsp; Then Beneyeh made a pretence of
writing letters to certain khans or chiefs of the frontier
tribes, but I suspect these are not worth much, for having no
seal of his own with him, the young jackanapes signed the letters
with a seal lent him by a bystander, an irregular and rather
suspicious proceeding, but we made no remark, being thankful at
any price to be freed from his company.&nbsp; With the grimace of
one who has played a successful trick he pocketed the money, and
then, without saying good-bye, mounted and rode off, our only
friend, the middle-aged man, to our sorrow following him.</p>
<p>We were now left alone with Dakher and his crew, who sat round
us while with infinite labour we loaded our camels.&nbsp; Poor
old Hajji Mohammed in his rusty uniform, with his sword dangling
between his legs, was anything but an efficient camel-man, and in
spite of the best will in the world things proceeded
slowly.&nbsp; It was as much as we could get out of Dakher that
he should tell one of his sulky fellows to lend an occasional
hand to the work, and keep the rest from getting in our
way.&nbsp; The help was given grudgingly, and in obedience rather
to Wilfrid&rsquo;s command, for he was now obliged to talk loud,
than of good-will.&nbsp; Dakher, however, <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>kept up a
semblance of politeness, being still our host, a position sacred
even in the eyes of the most abandoned, and when his brother
Ghafil appeared, announcing himself as our escort, we were
suffered to depart.</p>
<p>Once on our horses, and with the camels driven in front of us,
we felt more at ease; yet all were not a little anxious.&nbsp; We
should, I think, have turned back now but for the recollection of
Beneyeh and the river Tibb behind us, evils we knew of while the
unknown evils before us seemed preferable.&nbsp; For a while,
too, we flattered ourselves with the idea that Ghafil was to be
our only company, and for a mile or two the illusion lasted, and
we were reassured.&nbsp; There is something, besides, in a very
bright morning&rsquo;s march through a beautiful country, for we
were close to the hills, which prevents one feeling anxious, and
whatever its inhabitants may be, this frontier-land of Persia
looks like a Garden of Eden, with its grass and flowers knee deep
in every hollow.</p>
<p>Ghafil is another and a worse edition of Dakher, having, over
and above his brother&rsquo;s vices of countenance, a most
abominable squint.&nbsp; His face looks always like a
thunder-cloud, and the smiles on it, (for he smiles sometimes,
showing a wonderful set of white teeth from ear to ear) are like
the smiles of a wild beast.&nbsp; He has, too, a sort of
cat&rsquo;s manner, soft and cowardly, but very offensive.&nbsp;
At starting, and as long as he was alone with us, he <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>seemed
amiable enough, but at the end of about an hour we came up with
the rest of the party in whose company we were to travel, and
then his demeanour changed.&nbsp; These were not horsemen, or an
escort at all, but a collection of the most extraordinary
vagabonds we have ever seen.&nbsp; There were about forty of
them, with about twice as many beasts, camels, and oxen, which
they were driving before them loaded with empty sacks.&nbsp;
Amongst them were two women on foot, and there was a single
horseman heading the procession, mounted on a little white
mare.&nbsp; We asked them where they were going, and they
answered, &ldquo;To Dizful, to buy corn,&rdquo; and then in
return plied us with a hundred questions.&nbsp; Many of these
were not a little impertinent, but by parrying some, and
affecting not to understand the rest, we managed to hold our own,
even returning some of their small wit with interest on
themselves.&nbsp; Hajji Mohammed, however, poor man, was soon
singled out as a special butt for their mirth.&nbsp; His old
uniform coat they found supremely absurd, and he was as
mercilessly chaffed about his tailor as if he had been amongst a
party of roughs on the Epsom Downs, while he had not the sense
always to keep his temper.&nbsp; There was, besides, something
more than mere high spirits in their wit.&nbsp; He was a Suni,
and they were Shias, and religious bitterness made them
bitter.&nbsp; From words at last they seemed rapidly coming to
blows, when Wilfrid interfered, making his <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>horse
curvet amongst them, and dispersing them for a while.&nbsp; But
they soon returned, and it was all we could do to prevent the
poor cavass from being maltreated.&nbsp; One called on him to
dismount and give him a ride, another to let him have a shot with
his gun, and a third to fill him a pipe of tobacco, to none of
which demands the unfortunate Hajji knew how to give the proper
refusal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ya Hajji,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ya Hajji,&rdquo;
was the perpetual cry all the morning long; &ldquo;Where is your
pipe? where is your tobacco?&nbsp; Quick, I am thirsting for a
smoke.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ghafil in the meanwhile would do nothing or
could do nothing in the way of control, sitting on his camel
gloomily in silence, or talking in an undertone with a great
one-eyed rascal, more villainously hideous than himself.&nbsp;
The position was often almost unbearable, and only the doctrine
of patience which we had learned in Arabia, and a constant show
of good humour to the crowd, made it tolerable.&nbsp; In the
course of the afternoon, however, we managed to get upon some
sort of friendly terms with two or three of the rabble, so that
by the evening, when we stopped, we had established a little
party among them in our favour.&nbsp; This, I believe, was the
means of preventing a worse disaster, for it is nearly certain
that Ghafil and the more serious of the party meant us deliberate
mischief.</p>
<p>About an hour before sunset we came to a broad river, broader
and deeper than the Tibb, and here Ghafil decreed a halt.&nbsp;
If we had been a strong <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>enough party to shift for ourselves,
and if we could have crossed the river alone, we should now have
gone on and left our persecutors behind; but in our helpless
state this was impossible, and we had no choice but to
dismount.&nbsp; It was an anxious moment, but I think we did what
was wisest in showing no sign of distrust; and we had no sooner
stopped than we gave one a horse to hold, and another a gun,
while we called on others to help us unload the camels, and get
out coffee and provisions for a general feast.&nbsp; This seemed
to most of them too good an offer to be declined, and we had
already distributed a sack of flour and a sack of rice amongst
them, which the two women had promised to bake into loaves for
the whole party, when Ghafil and the one-eyed man, who had been
down to look for a ford, arrived upon the scene.&nbsp; They were
both very angry when they saw the turn things had taken, and were
at first for forbidding the people to eat with us, alleging that
we were kaffirs (infidels), so at least the people informed us
later, but this was more than they could insist on.&nbsp; They
would not, however, themselves eat with us or taste our coffee,
and remained apart with those of the party which had not made
friends with us.&nbsp; The women were on our side, and the better
sort of the young men.&nbsp; Still it was a terribly anxious
evening, for even our friends were as capricious as the winds,
and seemed always on the point of picking an open quarrel.&nbsp;
Later, they all went <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>away and left us to our own devices,
sitting round a great bonfire of brushwood they had built up,
&ldquo;to scare away lions,&rdquo; they said.&nbsp; We managed to
rig up our tent, and make a barricade of the camel-bags in such a
way that we could not be surprised and taken at a
disadvantage.&nbsp; I did not shut my eyes all night, but lay
watching the bonfire, win my hand on my gun.&nbsp; Hajji Mohammed
once in the darkness crept out and got near enough to overhear
something of their talk, and he assures us that there was a
regular debate as to whether and when and how we should be
murdered, in which the principal advocate of extreme measures was
the one-eyed man, a great powerful ruffian who carried a sort of
club, which he told us he used to frighten the lions, beating it
on the ground.&nbsp; The noise, he declared, sounded like a gun
and drove them away.&nbsp; With this tale of horror Hajji
Mohammed returned to comfort us; nor was it wholly a delusion,
for in the middle of the night, Wilfrid being asleep, and Hajji
Mohammed, whose watch it was, having fallen into a doze, I
distinctly saw Ghafil, who had previously come under pretext of
lions or robbers to reconnoitre, prowl stealthily round, and
seeing us all as he thought asleep, lift up the flap of the tent
and creep under on Wilfrid&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; I had remained
motionless, and from where I lay I could see his figure plainly
against the sky.&nbsp; As he stooped I called out in a loud
voice, &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; and at the sound he started
back, and <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>slunk away.&nbsp; This woke Hajji Mohammed, and nobody
slept again, but I could see Ghafil prowling like an hy&aelig;na
round us the best part of the night. <a name="citation152"></a><a
href="#footnote152" class="citation">[152]</a></p>
<p>Hajji Mohammed has behaved very well, though he owns himself
much frightened.&nbsp; So am I, only I conceal my alarm better
than he does.&nbsp; Indeed I am sure that putting on a bold face
is our only chance of safety, for nothing but cowardice now
prevents Ghafil and his set from attacking us.&nbsp; We are well
armed, and he knows he could not do it with impunity.&nbsp; As
long as we are on horseback, I believe we run no great risk, but
the night is a disagreeable time.&nbsp; If we had only open
desert in front of us we could set them all at defiance.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 31.&mdash;The morning broke tempestuously, and we
were afraid the river might have risen in the night, a
complication which would have probably decided our fate; but
though the clouds lay black and heavy on the hills there was no
flood.&nbsp; After trying several places, all of which proved too
deep, our akid, the man on the white mare, found a ford, if such
it can be called, for the water was over his mare&rsquo;s back,
and all the party followed him.&nbsp; The robbers, for so I now
call them, passed easily enough, for their camels were unloaded,
but ours barely managed it.&nbsp; The current was very strong,
and though Hatheran and the strongest of them came on boldly, two
of them stopped in the middle <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>and seemed on the point of turning
down and being swept away, when Wilfrid rode back below them,
into the deep water, and drove them on.&nbsp; It was nervous work
to watch them, seeing nothing of rider and horse but their heads,
but Job swam very well, and the camels were saved and all got
safely over.&nbsp; This incident proved a fortunate one, for it
impressed the better sort of the robbers with an idea of our
determination, and there was again a party in our favour.&nbsp;
It was fortunate that it was so, for we were no sooner across
than Ghafil and the one-eyed monster, Saadun, came forward with a
more menacing manner than they had yet dared to show, and said we
should proceed no further.&nbsp; It was plain enough what they
meant, but we affected not to understand them, and declaring in a
cheerful tone that it was a charming spot to stay in, with plenty
of grass and water for the beasts, at once consented to a
halt.&nbsp; Wilfrid begged Ghafil to sit down and smoke a pipe
with him, and when the man sulkily demurred, insisted on
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Ghafil,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here you are
my guest, as we have been yours; what can I do for you to make
you happy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wallah, ya Beg,&rdquo; interposed
Saadun, &ldquo;you have done nothing for him or any of us, and
now you must.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Must?&nbsp; Indeed, I shall be
too delighted.&nbsp; Tell me only in what I can assist
you&mdash;what it is that Ghafil wants.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ghafil then
began a long history about his dignity as Sheykh of the
expedition, and the disgrace it was to him to have <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>received no
cloak of honour from the Beg, and the insult that he had thus
received from us&mdash;at all which Wilfrid expressed the
greatest possible pain and surprise. <a name="citation154"></a><a
href="#footnote154" class="citation">[154]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;There
has been some mistake here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I would not
for the world that anyone should be treated with less respect
than was his due by me.&nbsp; The disgrace would be mine;&rdquo;
and he made a show of taking off his own cloak to give him; still
Ghafil seemed dissatisfied.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, it is not
that,&rdquo; said Saadun, in a stage whisper, &ldquo;what the
Sheykh wants is money&mdash;money, do you see?&mdash;money for
all of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And is it possible,&rdquo;
exclaimed Wilfrid, &ldquo;that you have all remained
unpaid?&mdash;that Beneyeh gave you nothing of what he received
from me?&mdash;that you have been working for me,
&lsquo;balash,&rsquo; for nothing?&nbsp; This is indeed a
disgrace.&nbsp; Come, Saadun, let us talk this matter over and
repair the mistake.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then took the one-eyed man by
the arm and led him aside for a private conference, while Ghafil
sat on gloomily with me.&nbsp; Wilfrid&rsquo;s first care, when
he got the Kurd alone, was to square him with a present of ten
krans (francs) for his own account, and a promise of twenty more
when we got to the Kerkha, judging rightly that this fellow was
in fact our most dangerous enemy.&nbsp; Then he intrusted him
with negotiating the rest of the blackmail with Ghafil.&nbsp; We
were prepared now for <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>almost any demand, for we were
completely in their power, and had a sum of nearly &pound;100
with us, besides property to the value of perhaps as much
more.&nbsp; We were consequently no little relieved when Saadun
returned with a demand of one hundred krans, and a silk abba, in
return for Ghafil&rsquo;s protection.&nbsp; This, after much
affected reluctance to part with so enormous a sum, and a
declaration at one moment that rather than pay we would stay
where we were for a month, we at last produced&mdash;giving the
robber the very silk abba which had been one of Ibn
Rashid&rsquo;s presents to us in Nejd&mdash;a white silk one,
embroidered with gold, but the only one we had; which being done
we were suffered to proceed.&nbsp; The truth of the matter
probably is that Ghafil dared not drive us to extremities, partly
from physical fear, for we soon had proof sufficient of his
cowardice, and partly because many of his men would not have
joined him in a deed of violence.&nbsp; Bloodshed is a thing no
Arab willingly consents to, however low his morality, especially
where a guest, or one who has been a guest, is in question; and
though the mongrel Kurds and Persians, who made up more than half
the band, would have abetted him, the rest would not.&nbsp; One
of the women, too, was Ghafil&rsquo;s wife, and the women were
openly friends with us.&nbsp; Another consideration may have been
that we were entering now upon an enemy&rsquo;s country, for the
Dueri is the limit of Beni Laam authority, and our men were too
miserable <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>cowards not to count upon us for something in case of
attack.&nbsp; Part of our agreement with Ghafil was that we were
to fight for him in case of need against the Persians, a promise
we readily gave.&nbsp; The atmosphere now was somewhat cleared,
and we started afresh under rather better conditions.&nbsp; The
teasing of Hajji Mohammed continued, but we ourselves were
treated with respect, and the one-eyed Kurd even occasionally
lent a hand in driving the camels, in company with a youth
clothed in green, who had hitherto been one of our worst
persecutors.</p>
<p>The whole party proceeded cautiously, avowing without the
slightest shame their immense fear of the Ajjem (the Persians),
whom they expected to meet at every turn of the road.&nbsp;
Beyond the Dueri we found ourselves in a beaten track, which
winds up and down over an undulating bit of desert, the last
ripple of the Hamrin hills which are now behind us.&nbsp; The
akid usually rode on in front to spy out possible enemies, and
all had orders to keep together.&nbsp; Ours, however, was such a
noisy party, that one would have thought its passage could have
been heard for miles round.&nbsp; The bullocks were getting tired
and required a great deal of driving, and the shouting and
screaming reminded one of an Irish fair.&nbsp; So we went on
without a halt till three o&rsquo;clock, when a halt was ordered
in a hollow, where we were out of sight of enemies, and where
there was a quantity of wild celery, and another edible <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>plant
called &ldquo;hakallah,&rdquo; which we found good, for we had
eaten nothing all day.&nbsp; Not far off were some sand mounds,
with tufts of what looked very like ithel, but we dared not leave
our camels to inspect them.&nbsp; The halt was only for
half-an-hour; then with shouts of &ldquo;Yalla yalla, erkob,
erkob,&rdquo; the mob went on.</p>
<p>We stopped again suddenly about an hour before sunset, and
this time in alarm.&nbsp; The akid, who had ridden to the top of
a low hill, was seen waving, as he came back, his abba, and
instantly the cry arose, &ldquo;El Ajjem, el Ajjem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In an instant everybody was huddled together in a hollow place,
like a covey of partridges when they see a hawk, and we were
entreated, commanded to dismount.&nbsp; A few hurried words with
the akid confirmed the terrible news of danger to the band, and
all seemed at their wits&rsquo; end with terror.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
many horsemen?&mdash;how many?&rdquo; we inquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Five,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but there are more
behind; and then these are the <i>Ajjem</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And if they <i>are</i> the Ajjem, and only five of them,
are you not forty of you here and able to fight?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; they screamed, &ldquo;you do not
understand.&nbsp; These horsemen are Persians&mdash;Persians;
every one of them capable of killing five of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
did not think men could be so craven-hearted.&nbsp; A few of the
least cowardly now crept up to the hill-top and one by one came
back to report; the number of horsemen seen rose rapidly from
five to fifteen and <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>eventually to fifty.&nbsp; When the
last number was reached, the coward Ghafil, who had kept well in
the middle of the mob, so as to be in the least possible danger,
came to us with his softest and most cringing manner, forgetful
of all his bullying, and begged us to be sure and do our best in
the battle which was imminent.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should stand in
front of the others,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and shoot as fast as
you can, and straight, so as to kill these Ajjem&mdash;dead you
understand&mdash;it is better to shoot them dead.&nbsp; You,
khat&uacute;n, know how to shoot, I am sure&mdash;and you will
not be afraid.&rdquo;&nbsp; We could not help laughing at him,
which shocked him dreadfully.&nbsp; Presently a man came rushing
up to say the enemy was coming, and again there was unutterable
confusion.&nbsp; The boy in green had begged some percussion caps
of Wilfrid for his gun, and had been given fifty, and this now
led to a wrangle, as he refused to share his prize with the
rest.&nbsp; Everybody was trying to borrow everybody else&rsquo;s
gun or spear or bludgeon, for they were very rudely armed, and
nobody would stand in front, but everybody behind.&nbsp; The
women alone seemed to have got their heads, while Ghafil, white
in the face, walked nervously up and down.&nbsp; We and the
cavass stood a little apart from the rest, holding our horses,
ready to fire and mount, and Wilfrid occupied the interval of
expectation with giving me instructions what to do if we got
separated in the fray.&nbsp; I was too well mounted to be
overtaken, and was to make for the Kerkha <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>river,
which we knew could not be far away to the east, and put myself
under the protection of the first Persian khan I should meet
there; if possible, Kerim Khan, to whom I had a letter in my
pocket, and who is a vakil of the Persian Government.&nbsp; We
hoped, however, that we might be able to keep together, and beat
off the enemy.&nbsp; Wilfrid called out to Ghafil, &ldquo;You
must tell me when to fire,&rdquo; but Ghafil was too frightened
to reply.&nbsp; Several of the men, however, called out,
&ldquo;Shoot at anybody you see&mdash;everybody here is an
enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The camels had been made to kneel down, and
the cattle had been huddled together; only a few of all the mob
looked as if they really meant to fight.&nbsp; They were silent
enough now, talking only in whispers.&nbsp; So we remained
perhaps for half-an-hour; then somebody ran up the hill again to
look, and Wilfrid, tired of waiting, proposed that we should eat
our dinner, as we had had nothing all day.&nbsp; I got some bread
and a pomegranate out of the del&uacute;l bag, and we were soon
at work, much to the disgust of the rest, who were shocked at our
levity in such a moment.&nbsp; Presently there was another alarm
and the people called to me to come inside their square, meaning
kindly I think, but of course we would do no such thing, being
really much safer where we were with our mares.&nbsp; Still no
enemy came, and when we had finished our meal we tied our
horses&rsquo; halters to our arms and lay down in our cloaks; we
were very tired and soon were sound <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>asleep.&nbsp; Nothing more was heard
of the enemy that night.</p>
<p>But our troubles were not to end here.&nbsp; We were hardly
comfortably asleep, before a tremendous crash of thunder roused
us and a downpour of rain.&nbsp; On putting our heads out of our
cloaks we saw our valiant escort rigging up our servants&rsquo;
tent for themselves.&nbsp; They were terribly afraid of getting
washed in the rain, and were shrieking to us to come inside too,
indignant at Wilfrid&rsquo;s &ldquo;ma yukhalif&rdquo;
(&ldquo;never mind&rdquo;), with which he had already treated
their remonstrances on other occasions.&nbsp; Indeed, &ldquo;ma
yukhalif&rdquo; had now become a sort of nickname with them, and
no dishonourable one, I think, for the person concerned.&nbsp; We
neither of us could think of joining them in the tent, but having
managed to get a couple of horse-rugs from the del&uacute;l bag,
we covered ourselves over again and went to sleep; Sayad and
Shiekha creeping in under them to keep us company.&nbsp; All of a
sudden the rain stopped, and before we were well aware, the mob
was again on the march.&nbsp; It was pitch dark, and we were
within an ace of being left behind, a circumstance which perhaps
we should have hardly regretted.&nbsp; Still, now we felt that
our position with the robbers was such, that we ran less danger
in their company than alone; and we all hurried on
together.&nbsp; Ghafil was polite again; and the rest, feeling, I
suppose, that the journey was nearly over, and their power over
us <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>vanishing, even made us offers of assistance.&nbsp; A
long, weary night march we had, and at dawn found ourselves
descending rapidly into a broad plain, knee deep in
pasture.&nbsp; This was the valley of the Kerkha; and as it grew
light we became aware of a long line of mounds, with two kubbrs
or shrines in front of us, which Ghafil told us were the ruins of
Eywan.&nbsp; At seven o&rsquo;clock we saw tents within the
circuit of the ancient city, and some shepherds in conical felt
caps, and sheepskin dresses, the costume of the Bactiari and
other tribes of Kurdish origin.&nbsp; We were in Persia.</p>
<p>Ghafil now went forward to announce our arrival to Sirdal
Khan, the chieftain at whose tents we now are.&nbsp; But I must
leave further details for to-morrow.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">A prince in exile&mdash;Tea money&mdash;Rafts
on the Kerkha&mdash;Last words with the Beni Laam&mdash;Kerim
Khan&mdash;Beautiful Persia&mdash;We arrive at Dizful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sirdal Khan</span> is a Shahzade, or
member of the Royal family of Persia, many of whom are to be
found living in official, and even private capacities in
different parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; He himself had fallen into
disgrace with the Court many years ago, and had been exiled from
Persia proper, a misfortune which led to his taking up his
residence with a section of the semi-dependent Seguand tribe of
Lurs, where he became Khan or Chieftain.&nbsp; Both in looks and
in manner, he stands in striking contrast with the people round
him, having the handsome, regular features, long nose and
melancholy, almond-shaped eyes of the family of the Shah, which,
I believe, is not of Persian origin, and a certain dignity of
bearing very different from the rude want of manners of the
Lurs.&nbsp; These would seem to be of Tartar origin,
coarse-featured, short-faced men, honest in their way and brave,
but <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>quite ignorant of those graces of address which even
the worst Arabs are not wholly without.&nbsp; Sirdal, when he
arrived among the Lurs, was possessed of considerable wealth,
which he invested in flocks and herds, and until a short time
before our visit he was living in Bedouin magnificence.&nbsp; But
his enemies it would seem still pursued him, and not satisfied
with his disgrace, molested him even in his exile.&nbsp; By some
means, the rights of which we did not learn, they managed to
instigate against him a rival chief, one Kerim Khan, who, under
Government sanction, made a successful raid upon his flocks,
stripping the unfortunate prince of everything, and driving him
and his tribe across the Kerkha river into the No Man&rsquo;s
Land, which lies between Persia and Turkey, and which we had just
crossed.&nbsp; In this position he has been obliged to maintain
himself as he could, making terms with Mizban and the Beni Laam,
who are his nearest neighbours westwards.&nbsp; The river Kerkha
is considered the boundary of Persia, and as it is a large and
rapid river, nearly half a mile across, he is in comparative
safety from the east.&nbsp; Ghafil, therefore, as a Beni Laam,
was on friendly terms with him, though it was easy to see that he
despised and had no kind of sympathy with him or the ruffians of
his band.&nbsp; By Hajji Mohammed&rsquo;s advice, and to secure
ourselves against further risks at their hands, we accordingly
placed ourselves at once under the Khan&rsquo;s protection.&nbsp;
Hajji Mohammed fortunately <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>knows both Persian and Kurdish, and
soon explained to Sirdal the circumstances of our position, and
he, delighted to meet once more with respectable people, readily
assented.&nbsp; He received us with great kindness, made us
comfortable in his tent, which, in spite of his poverty, was
still more luxurious than any found among the Arabs; having
partitions of matting worked in worsted with birds and beasts,
carpets, and a fire, and gave us what we were much in want of, an
excellent breakfast of well served rice and lamb.&nbsp; Then,
when we had pitched our own tent just outside, he provided us
with an efficient guard of Lurs, who soon sent our robber
acquaintance of the last few days about their business.&nbsp;
There is no love lost between them and the Arabs.&nbsp; Presently
I received a visit from the Khan&rsquo;s wife, whom he has lately
married, and his mother, a well-bred person with perfect manners,
and a refined, pleasing face.&nbsp; She was in black, in mourning
she explained for a son; she has five sons, including the Khan,
whose brothers live with him.&nbsp; A crowd of Seguand ladies
came in her company, and an Arab woman who had been nurse to one
of the Khan&rsquo;s children, and who served me as
interpreter.&nbsp; Ghafil&rsquo;s wife, too, one of the poor
women who had travelled with us, came in and joined the
conversation.&nbsp; She is loud in her complaints of Ghafil, who
treats her ill.&nbsp; He is now very polite, and presented
himself during the <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>afternoon at our tent as if nothing had happened, with
a little girl named Norah in his arms whom he told us was his
niece, he having a sister here married to one of Sirdal&rsquo;s
men.&nbsp; I had a carpet spread for the ladies outside our tent,
for it could not have held them all, and they sat round me for an
hour or more, curious and enquiring, but exceedingly
polite.&nbsp; They admired especially my boots and gloves, which
I pulled off to show them.&nbsp; One of them, turning up my
sleeve, exclaimed at the whiteness of my wrist.&nbsp; At the end
of an hour the elder lady rose, and wishing me affectionately
good morning, took her leave, the rest following.</p>
<p>We then had a pleasant day of peace and a sound night&rsquo;s
rest, hardly disturbed by the ferocious shouting and singing of
our guard, which, under other circumstances, might have been
frightening.&nbsp; Anything more wild and barbarous than their
chaunting I never listened to, but to us it was sweet as music,
for we knew that it was raised to scare our jackals, the Beni
Laam.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 2.&mdash;Next day we crossed the Kerkha.&nbsp;
When we saw the size of the river, swollen with melted snow and
running eight miles an hour, and as wide as the Thames at
Greenwich, we felt thankful indeed for having met Sirdal
Khan.&nbsp; Here there would have been no fording possible, and
we, or at least our goods, would have been at the mercy of our
robber escort.&nbsp; The Khan, however, agreed for a sum of
money, 100 krans <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>(nothing in Persia is done for nothing, either by
prince or peasant), to have us ferried over with our baggage to
the Persian shore, and our camels and horses swum after us.&nbsp;
Hospitality is not a virtue real or pretended with the Persians,
and the Khan, prince as he was and a really charming man,
explained to Hajji Mohammed without affectation, that sixty of
the one hundred krans he would count as &ldquo;tea money,&rdquo;
or as the Spaniards would say, &ldquo;ruido de casa,&rdquo;
payment for board and lodging.&nbsp; To this, however, we were
indifferent, and appreciate none the less his kindness and good
manners.&nbsp; He rode with us himself to the river on a
well-bred Arabian mare he told us was &ldquo;asil,&rdquo; as it
well might be, and saw that all things in the matter of the rafts
were done as they should be.&nbsp; At first we rode through the
mounds of Eywan, which are disposed in a quadrangle fronting the
river, and where we found plentiful remains of pottery; then past
the kubbr of I forget what Mohammedan saint, facing a similar
kubbr on the eastern bank; then across some fordable branches of
the river and islands clothed with guttub and canora trees, to
the main body of the Kerkha, where we found a raft
preparing.&nbsp; The canora bushes had fruit on them, which the
Khan politely picked, and gave me to eat, little yellow fruits,
pleasantly acid, like medlars, and with stones inside.</p>
<p>The passage of the river was a tedious, not to say difficult,
process, the single raft being composed of <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>twenty
skins only, and very crank.&nbsp; We found besides, to our
disgust, and also waiting to take advantage of our passage, our
late disagreeable companions, Ghafil, the one-eyed Kurd, and all
the rest, who presently began a loud argument with the Lurs as to
who should pilot our camels through the water, a ticklish duty,
which required both knowledge of the animals and skill in
swimming, to perform successfully.&nbsp; At first we were
naturally in favour of the Lurs, and unwilling to trust any part
of our property with the mongrel Arabs; but when it came to the
point of testing their capabilities, the Lurs broke lamentably
down, being hardly able to manage the camels even on dry land, so
by the Khan&rsquo;s advice we let the Bedouins manage the
business, which I must say they performed with no little courage
and skill.&nbsp; It takes two men to swim a camel safely.&nbsp;
First of all the beast must be unloaded to the skin.&nbsp; Then a
cord is tied to the tail for one man to hold by, and another
mounts on his back.&nbsp; Thus he is driven into the water, and
pushed on gradually till he loses his legs.&nbsp; The man on his
back then floats off down stream of him, and holding with one
hand by the hump, splashes water in the camel&rsquo;s face to
keep his head straight, while the other urges him from
behind.&nbsp; The camel seems heavier than most animals in the
water, showing nothing but the tip of his nose above the surface,
and he is a slow swimmer.&nbsp; It was an anxious quarter of an
hour <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>for
us while they were crossing, and great was the speculation among
the bystanders as to the result.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yetla,&rdquo;
&ldquo;ma yetla,&rdquo; &ldquo;he does it,&rdquo; &ldquo;he
doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; were the cries as they were carried down
the river.&nbsp; The strongest pushed fairly straight across, but
those in the worst condition seemed borne helplessly along till
camel and men and all disappeared out of our sight,&mdash;and we
had already given them up as lost, when we saw them emerging
quite a mile down upon the bank.&nbsp; Then we ourselves and the
luggage were put across, the mares swimming with us, though they
got across much quicker than we did.&nbsp; The raft was hardly
eight feet square, a rough framework of tamarisk poles lashed
together on twenty goat skins.&nbsp; Our luggage went first, with
Hajji Mohammed perched on the top of it, booted and cloaked, and
loaded with gun and cartridge bag, sublimely indifferent, though
an accident would have sent him like lead to the bottom.&nbsp; We
ourselves were more prudent, and divested ourselves of every
superfluous garment before taking our seats, which we did in the
company of our dogs and bird, and of Ghafil&rsquo;s wife, who
nearly upset us at starting by jumping in from the shore upon
us.&nbsp; Our feet were in the water all the way, and our hearts
in our mouths, but by the mercy of Providence, we finally reached
land amid a chorus of such &ldquo;betting on the event&rdquo; as
had accompanied the camels.&nbsp; The last creature of our party
was the little hamra mare, which Sirdal&rsquo;s servant had been
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>holding,
and which, slipping her halter, came bravely across alone.</p>
<p>Just across the river lives Kerim Khan, Sirdal&rsquo;s enemy,
a Kurdish chief in government pay.&nbsp; To him we had letters,
and nothing more remained but to go to his camp, and ask his help
to forward us to Dizful.</p>
<p>Our former enemies now came round us like a swarm of gnats,
begging and praying us to let them be of some use.&nbsp; They
wanted to tack themselves on to our party, and so go to Dizful in
safety, under cover of our companionship; for it appears that
they dare not go further than this without protection.&nbsp; The
Persian authorities here are apt to imprison any of the Beni Laam
who enter their district, and these people therefore seldom
venture beyond the Kerkha, or just this side of it.&nbsp; Even
so, they are sometimes caught: we saw a Beni Laam last night who
had just arrived at the Seguand camp on his way home after three
or four months&rsquo; imprisonment at Dizful, besides having to
pay a fine of one hundred and fifty krans.&nbsp; He was accused,
no doubt justly, of sheep stealing, and he told us that several
others of Mizban&rsquo;s people are at this moment in jail at
Dizful.</p>
<p>The elder Ghafil finding that nothing could be got from us by
persuasion, tried a little of his old blustering and threats, but
several of Kerim Khan&rsquo;s people were standing by, and he was
powerless here, so we had the pleasure of giving him a piece of
our mind before he retired.&nbsp; His younger <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>namesake,
the man in green, could not contain his rage at our escape, and
openly expressed his regret that we had not been killed in the
wilderness as had been intended.&nbsp; After this little scene we
saw no more of either of them, for though we afterwards heard of
them in Kerim Khan&rsquo;s camp, they never dared come back into
our presence.</p>
<p>There now came forward to welcome us a funny little boy with
half-shut eyes, riding a good-looking chestnut mare.&nbsp; He
dismounted, introduced himself as the Khan&rsquo;s son, and
invited us to his father&rsquo;s tents.&nbsp; These he said lay
close by, but we were not yet at the end of this day&rsquo;s
difficulties.&nbsp; A network of irrigation, and a deep muddy
canal had to be passed, and the camels which had so successfully
escaped the dangers of the river, were again nearly perishing,
and more ignobly, in the mud.&nbsp; The Kurds on this side the
river were useless to assist us, as in their ignorance of camels
they only made matters worse, and but for the sudden reappearance
of the one-eyed giant, who had been once our greatest enemy, I
think we should have all stuck fast.&nbsp; But now he made amends
for part of his misdeeds and ill-designs by lending a powerful
hand.&nbsp; He and Wilfrid between them unloaded the camels, and
carried the luggage over on their heads up to their waists in
holding mud, and then dragged through the camels.&nbsp; The boy,
meanwhile, had gone to fetch help from his father; and we were
hardly across, when he reappeared, still on his <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>chestnut
mare, a Keh&icirc;leh Harkan, he told us, from the Beni Laam, for
all the tribes here get their horses from the Arabs.&nbsp; And
then we saw a cavalcade approaching, and in the midst a portly
figure on an old grey mare, whom the boy introduced to us as the
Khan.</p>
<p>Kerim Khan is, after Huseyn Koli Khan of the Bactiari, the
most powerful chief of Luristan.&nbsp; His tribe occupies most of
the district formerly known as Susiana, and from his camp on the
Kerkha the ruins of Susa, now merely mounds, were visible.&nbsp;
The land east of the river is very fertile, and being moreover
well irrigated, is mostly under cultivation.&nbsp; Though living
in tents, these Lurs can hardly be called nomadic, for their
camps are permanent ones, at least for many months
together.&nbsp; The one where we now found ourselves was in
appearance quite as much a village as it was a camp, the tents
being pitched close together in rows, and from their pent house
shape looking exceedingly like houses.&nbsp; In the centre of the
camp is a large open space, within which the sheep and cattle of
this section of the tribe are driven at night.&nbsp; These,
however, are not numerous, for Kerim Khan&rsquo;s people are
cultivators of the soil, rather than shepherds.&nbsp; We noticed
many good-looking horses about, procured, they told us, mostly
from the Beni Laam.</p>
<p>The tent in which we were lodged was a most elaborate
construction.&nbsp; Its roof was of the same material as that
used by the Arabs, goat&rsquo;s hair <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>cloth, but the side walls were of
carpet stuff, with intervals of open grass matting, through which
the air circulated pleasantly.&nbsp; It had, besides, a regular
door, while inside were some handsome Persian carpets spread near
a lighted fire, which we soon made use of to dry our clothes, for
we were wet through, with the rivers and canals we had
crossed.&nbsp; The Lurs themselves differ even more from the
Arabs, than their habitations from Bedouin tents.&nbsp; They have
none of the Bedouin dignity of manner, and their dress is a mean
one, a square coat of felt, and a little felt skull-cap, from
under which their black hair curls up in a single greasy
wave.&nbsp; Their voices, too, to one coming from among the
Arabs, sounded exceedingly absurd, as they have a sort of
sing-song intonation, and are pitched so high as to be almost in
falsetto.&nbsp; This with the drawl, which we had noticed before
in Ali Koli Khan, made us at first inclined to laugh.&nbsp; Kerim
Khan keeps his people in excellent order, and no crowding round
us or importunate questioning was permitted.&nbsp; The great man
himself, though far from dignified in appearance, was
well-mannered, and when he came, after having first sent us
breakfast, to see us in our new tent, conversed politely, first a
few words of Arabic, and afterwards in Kurdish, which Hajji
Mohammed interpreted.&nbsp; We told him of our adventures, and of
our intended visit to the Bactiari chieftain, with whom he was
well acquainted, and of our journey from Ha&iuml;l with Ali <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Koli Khan,
his son.&nbsp; I am not sure that he altogether believed us, when
Hajji Mohammed added, that we were persons of distinction
travelling for amusement.&nbsp; In Persia, it is the custom to
judge strangers entirely by the appearance they make, and we,
travelling in our poor Arab clothes, and accompanied by a single
servant, gained less credit in his eyes than we should have found
with Arabs, who care nothing for externals.&nbsp; He promised,
however, to send us on with two horsemen on the following day to
Dizful, and thence, if we would, to the Bactiari.&nbsp; In a
private conference, however, later with the cavass, he imposed
his conditions.&nbsp; We were to pay him ten tomams (four pounds
sterling), as &ldquo;tea-money,&rdquo; an exorbitant demand,
which we were nevertheless obliged to accede to.&nbsp;
Hospitality here is never given gratis, nor has anyone much shame
of begging, for even our little friend and first acquaintance
here, the boy on the chestnut mare, though his father is
evidently a very rich man, spares no occasion of asking money,
&ldquo;for his bride,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; Gold is what he likes
best.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 3.&mdash;The Khan and his son rode with us for
half a mile this morning, to see us started on our way to
Dizful.&nbsp; He has given us two horsemen as he promised, so at
least we have something for our money, and they seem respectable
people.&nbsp; We had hardly ten miles to go, and the road, for
there was a road, was in tolerable order, and the men helped us
drive our camels according to such lights in <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>camel
driving as they possessed.&nbsp; At first, we made a circuit, so
as to cross the canal at a place where there was an old stone
bridge, and in so doing we passed not two miles from Shush, the
ancient Susa.&nbsp; Wilfrid would have liked to visit the mound,
but I was impatient to get on, and in fact there is nothing
above-ground by all accounts to see.&nbsp; Then we travelled
through a beautiful plain, bounded by the splendid line of the
Bactiari mountains, still covered almost to their base with snow,
a refreshing sight, for the sun was now very hot.&nbsp; At their
foot, we could make out the town of Dizful, indistinctly at
first, and then clearly, while all around us lay well-cultivated
fields of waving corn just turning yellow.&nbsp; Here and there
grew shady canora trees, and there were many rills of
water.&nbsp; Now and then, too, a village shaped like a fortress,
with a surrounding wall of sun-dried bricks, on the roofs of
which storks had built their nests, and were clattering with
their bills.&nbsp; In the fields, we heard francolins calling and
quails; and the roadside was gay with flowers, red, blue, and
yellow.&nbsp; Several times we stopped in the shade of a tree,
and let the horses and camels graze on the crops, for so our
horsemen insisted we should do, and there was no hurry.&nbsp;
Travellers here are probably too scarce for grazing rules to be
enforced against them.&nbsp; Nor did the peasants we met seem to
mind.&nbsp; We were in Persia at last, and the country seemed
very delightful.</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock, we came to a large village by <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>the side of
a broad shallow stream of transparent water, flowing over a bed
of pebbles, and overhung by shady trees.&nbsp; A group of women
were washing their clothes, and the road was full of country
people on foot and donkey-back, crossing the ford.&nbsp; A pretty
picture, such as we had hardly seen since we left Syria.&nbsp;
This, and a second river which we passed presently, are called
the Bellar&uacute;, and cover with their various branches nearly
a mile of country.&nbsp; The water in them was cold enough to
make a pleasant coolness in the air, coming like the Kerkha water
from the snows.&nbsp; Then at two o&rsquo;clock, we found
ourselves close to Dizful, set picturesquely on the great river
Diz, which is spanned by a fine old bridge of squared masonry,
the work of ancient times.&nbsp; The town itself occupies some
high ground beyond the river, that is to say on its left bank,
but on this side, there is not a single house.&nbsp; The bridge
is the main feature.&nbsp; It has twenty-one arches, some
pointed, some round, with buttresses to break the stream.&nbsp;
It is very much out of repair, there being one hole in it big
enough for a camel to fall through.&nbsp; It would seem to belong
in part to the age of the Persian monarchy, in part to that of
the Caliphs, but I have not sufficient knowledge of architecture
to feel sure about this.</p>
<p>In any case, here we are at Dizful, and once more under a
settled government, with police and soldiers, and all the other
blessings of civilisation at our call.&nbsp; We may be thankful
that it is so.</p>

its river, and its garden&mdash;A telegraph clerk.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 4.&mdash;Dizful, though still alive with a
population of 30,000 persons, and a certain amount of traffic,
for it is the corn market of the tribes westwards on the Ottoman
frontier, and eastwards on the Bactiari, now possesses but the
shadow of its past prosperity, if we may judge from the neglected
condition of its magnificent bridge and the ruined walls which
remain to mark its former circumference.&nbsp; Between these and
the limit within which the present inhabited town has shrunk,
lies a widish strip of unoccupied land.&nbsp; Here we have our
camp in a hollow out of sight from the road, and here we had
hoped to remain unnoticed and undisturbed.&nbsp; But alas, it was
Friday, and the whole population turned out at daybreak, and
there was no chance of escaping discovery.&nbsp; All the
inhabitants of Dizful, men, women, and children, have been idling
about, holiday-making in their best <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>clothes all day long, with
apparently nothing to do but stare at us.&nbsp; I am sure they
consider the arrival of a party of strangers as a God-send, for
from early dawn until an hour ago, at the <i>asr</i> when the
governor sent three soldiers to disperse them, they have
literally swarmed round our tent like their own flies.&nbsp; Not
content, as Arabs are, with looking on from a reasonable
distance, these Persians persist in trying to thrust their way
inside the tent, and not succeeding, they sit down in rows so
close to it that we cannot stir without pushing somebody
away.&nbsp; Besides, they cannot look with their eyes; they must
touch everything with their fingers, and they must laugh and
talk, and have answers to all their foolish questions.&nbsp; They
mean no harm, but it is very tiresome, and has hindered us not a
little in our repairs and preparations.&nbsp; The camel saddles
and bags wanted mending, the camels had to be doctored for mange,
with an ointment which had first to be mixed, the horses to be
shod, the stores looked through, purchases to be made of rope and
provisions, and all this with several hundred persons at
one&rsquo;s elbow; each ready with advice and interference.</p>
<p>Our appearance, I have no doubt, is a great temptation to
them, for there can be few things more unutterably dull than one
of their festivities.&nbsp; Pigeon-flying is here as much the
fashion as it is at Aleppo, and there is the same element of
gambling in the performance.&nbsp; The birds are let <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>loose from
their separate dovecots, and allure each other home; such at
least is the explanation given us of the excitement shown in
watching them.&nbsp; Whoever gets most birds from his neighbour
wins.&nbsp; Then there are dervishes and seyyids in green clothes
who go about selling sugar-plums and collecting alms; and a few
of the richest have horses on which they gallop about.&nbsp; We,
however, in our Arab dresses, are a perplexity and an endless
source of inquiry to all; and our dogs, and our falcon, and our
camels, excite almost as much interest as they might in Hyde Park
or the Champs Elys&eacute;es.&nbsp; We should have done far
better to stay the other side of the river, where there is an
honest bit of desert much more in keeping with our establishment,
and where nobody comes.&nbsp; Rasham, too, to add to our
troubles, got loose and flew wildly about over the crowd, and
could not be caught till Wilfrid climbed to the top of a tower
there was in the city wall, and lured him down.&nbsp; We were
almost at our wits&rsquo; end with the mob when the
governor&rsquo;s guard arrived, and restored order.&nbsp; I
profit by the quiet thus secured, and by the last hour of
daylight, to write my journal.</p>
<p>Besides the vulgar populace, several polite and well-to-do
inhabitants have called on us; the most agreeable of them, a
party of four, came in the morning, and afterwards spent the day
sitting under the shade of the ruined wall close by, where <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>Wilfrid
returned their visit.&nbsp; In the afternoon they came
again.&nbsp; They were Ardeshir Khan, a very dignified and very
fat man; Pasha Khan, next in dignity and fat; Yusef Khan, thin
and very dark; and lastly, Aga Shukra Allah, red-haired and
speaking a little Arabic, and thus able to converse with us and
interpret for his friends.</p>
<p>The wife of one of these gentlemen sent to propose to come and
see me, and on my accepting, arrived immediately with a score of
attendants.&nbsp; We sat together on my carpet, which I ordered
to be spread near the tent; but with the best will in the world,
our conversation was but halting; Hajji Mohammed is not a fluent
dragoman, and he grows deafer every day.&nbsp; A seyyid also
called on us and brought his little girl, named Khat&uacute;n, a
funny little thing of five, to whom I gave a silver kran; then
some rather ill-mannered persons calling themselves
Sab&aelig;ans. <a name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179"
class="citation">[179]</a></p>
<p>Two or three people have been riding about on horseback; one
on a very handsome little bay horse, said to be of Nejd origin,
brought back by a pilgrim, as it is the fashion for pilgrims who
can afford to do so, to bring back a colt from Nejd.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s pilgrims they tell us have not yet returned,
and we are the first to announce their arrival at Meshhed
Ali.&nbsp; We hoped to have heard something here of our friend
Ali Koli Khan, but are disappointed.&nbsp; He intended to go by
water <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>from Bagdad to Mohammra or Ahwas, and so to Shustar and
home&mdash;the usual route, in fact&mdash;for ours is not a road
travelled by respectable people.&nbsp; Dizful communicates with
the outer world only by Shustar.&nbsp; It is of no use, however,
waiting for Ali Koli.&nbsp; We cannot spare the time, and must
pay our visit to Huseyn Koli Khan now or not at all.&nbsp; No one
can tell us exactly where to find the Bactiari chief, some saying
he is at Shustar, some at Teheran, while all agree that some of
his people are encamped between this and Shustar, and to Shustar
we consequently mean to go.</p>
<p>Our last visit was from the governor or deputy-governor, who
being, we suspect, not quite sober, (for the Persians drink wine)
behaved so oddly that Wilfrid had to beg him to take himself off
there and then.&nbsp; On the whole, our day&rsquo;s rest at
Dizful has been hardly a pleasant one.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 5.&mdash;Shaking the dust of this very tiresome
city from our feet, we resumed our march to-day.&nbsp; We are
depressed at the poor reception we have received after all in
Persia, the country we have heard of so long as famed for its
politeness, but perhaps we ourselves are to blame.&nbsp; Hajji
Mohammed tells us we should have travelled in a different way,
and he is probably right.&nbsp; The Persians, he says, judge only
from what they see, and have no idea that people travelling
without servants can be respectable.&nbsp; We should have come
with a retinue, an escort of fifty men and half as <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>many
servants.&nbsp; Then we should have been <i>f&ecirc;ted</i>
everywhere.&nbsp; But it is too late now, and we must travel on
as we can.</p>
<p>We took the Shustar road this morning, a well-travelled track,
passing at first through corn-fields and villages, and then
across a fine plain of grass.&nbsp; The soil here looks richer
than any I have ever seen in any part of the world, and it is
well-watered and wooded with canora trees.&nbsp; We are marching
parallel with the mountains, a lovely range crowned with snow,
and quite 8000 to 10,000 feet above the sea.&nbsp; Immediately to
our right, a wonderful square-topped hill stands out in front of
the main range; a <i>diz</i>, or fortress, the people call
it.&nbsp; We have passed several encampments of Bactiari;
wild-looking people, who when you ride up to their tents, run at
once to their guns as though they expected constantly to be
attacked.&nbsp; They are guarded by some of the most ferocious
dogs I ever saw, which were with difficulty prevented from
attacking Shiekha and Sayad.&nbsp; Their masters, however, are
not inhospitable when things are explained, and we had several
basins of milk offered us on the way.&nbsp; From them we have
learned that the Khani, as they call their chief, is somewhere on
the road, and the prospect has cheered us not a little.&nbsp;
To-night we are encamped all alone, except for the company of an
old Arab and his wife, who joined us on the road&mdash;Chaab
Arabs they call themselves&mdash;who have been useful, <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>helping us
with the camels.&nbsp; There are many Bedouin Arabs, it appears,
in this part of Persia.&nbsp; We have got a sheep to-night, and
are to have a feast.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 6.&mdash;The Bactiari tents are like those of the
Arabs, but the men are dressed as I have described the Seguand,
and Kerim Khan&rsquo;s people.&nbsp; They keep horses, and carry
lances or guns, but I saw no horses which seemed well-bred.&nbsp;
Early in the morning a man came from one of their tents, and told
us that the Khani had passed the night not ten miles from where
we were, at a place called Obeyd, which our two guides from Kerim
Khan knew well.&nbsp; It lay off the high-road to the left, just
under the square-topped hill we noticed yesterday.&nbsp; Though
anxious now to get on to Shustar, where alone we can procure
servants (and they are a necessity we feel more and more every
day), we could not of course forego our visit to Ali Koli&rsquo;s
father, and taking a line in the direction pointed out, struck
out to the north somewhat back from our yesterday&rsquo;s line of
march.&nbsp; It was a rough bit of travelling over broken rocky
ground, cut up here and there with streams.&nbsp; Very beautiful,
however, for in every hollow there grew real turf brilliantly
green, and sprinkled over with borage flowers and anemones; and
wherever there was a pool of water, frogs were croaking among the
weeds.&nbsp; Our progress was slow, for Assad, one of our men,
had bought a donkey at the camp, with a new born foal, and as the
foal could not walk, he carried it before him on his horse.&nbsp;
He was <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>continually letting it slip off, and stopping to hoist
it up again.&nbsp; Towards nine o&rsquo;clock, we came to a ridge
of limestone, overlooking a wide valley out of which the square
crag we had been following rose like a wall of masonry, five
hundred feet or more; beyond which again, lay the snow range of
the Bactiari.&nbsp; While we were looking and admiring, we heard
shots fired, and knew that there must be a camp in the valley,
the Khani&rsquo;s, we hoped, and so it proved.&nbsp; But before
descending, the two Persians insisted upon going through an
elaborate furbishing of themselves and their clothes.&nbsp; There
was a little pool close by, and there they washed and combed
themselves, and then washed their clothes, spreading them
afterwards on the rocks to dry.&nbsp; We in the meanwhile found a
bit of shade under a rock and slept.&nbsp; It was about noon when
we woke and went down to the valley, where we presently saw a
large building, the fort of Obeyd, with half-a-dozen white canvas
tents grouped round it.&nbsp; This was Huseyn Koli Khan&rsquo;s
travelling camp, and the fort was also his.&nbsp; It is modern
and in good repair, a square building flanked with towers,
surrounding a courtyard.</p>
<p>In the middle of the camp stood the Khani&rsquo;s reception
tent like a great umbrella, for the side walls were taken down
for the heat.&nbsp; There Huseyn Koli sat in state surrounded by
a kind of court.</p>
<p>Huseyn Koli Khan is the greatest chieftain of all Western
Persia.&nbsp; He is said to be able to put <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>20,000
horsemen into the field, and this may very well be true, as the
whole of the south-western slopes of the mountains are occupied
by his tribe.&nbsp; In person he is imposing without being
particularly good-looking; he is a thick-set rather heavy man,
with a broad face, brown beard and hair, and I think grey
eyes.&nbsp; He reminds me of a picture I have seen somewhere of
Ghenghis Khan, or another Mongul prince, from whom it is not
altogether impossible he may be descended.&nbsp; His manner is
very straightforward and plain, and he gives one the impression
of being altogether an honest man.&nbsp; He received us very
cordially, made us sit down by him in the middle of his courtiers
who were standing obsequiously round him, and gave us some cups
of excellent tea.</p>
<p>The manner of tea-making in Persia deserves notice, inasmuch
as the tea is there put into the boiling water, while with us the
boiling water is poured on the tea; and tea made in the Persian
fashion is without the bitter taste too often the result of our
method.</p>
<p>We spent an hour or two thus with the Khan, giving him the
latest news of his son, who it appears is expected daily now from
Ahwas, and learning much about the road which still lies between
us and Bushire.&nbsp; The Khan is on his way to Teheran, where he
has rank under the Shah as a general in the army, so is unable to
invite us to visit him in the mountains where his home is, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>and where
he keeps the stud of Arab mares for which his name is
famous.&nbsp; This would be more unfortunate if we did not now
recognise the necessity of getting without further delay to the
coast.&nbsp; The weather in the last two days has become suddenly
hot, and it would be folly to allow ourselves to be caught by the
summer with so long a march before us.&nbsp; Besides, we are
hardly in such travelling order as to allow of great
experiments.&nbsp; In spite of all our exertions, and all our
offers of high wages, we cannot get any one to drive our
camels.&nbsp; The fact is, the camel is almost as strange a beast
here as he would be in England, and camel-drivers about as
scarce.&nbsp; So we are to go to Shustar to-morrow accompanied by
a confidential man of the Khani&rsquo;s, who will put us into
good hands.</p>
<p>We had a grand debate on returning to our tent whether or not
to send presents to our host; but on Hajji Mohammed&rsquo;s
advice, and rather against our own judgment, at last did
so.&nbsp; But our host would receive nothing, saying that it was
for him to do honour to his guests, and that he wanted
nothing.&nbsp; He has sent us a most excellent dinner now,
consisting of half-a-dozen really well-cooked dishes, things we
had not tasted since we left Bagdad.&nbsp; There is also a live
lamb to take with us to-morrow, and two large boxes of sweetmeats
made of fruits and flowers.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 7.&mdash;Our visit to Huseyn Koli Khan, though a
disappointment in some ways, for it was <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>but a
morning call, has been none the less a good fortune to us.&nbsp;
The confidential man whom the Khan sent with us brought us early
into Shustar, and through his intervention we are now comfortably
established in a really delightful place, the deserted palace of
the Shahzade, or Prince Governor of the province, which is to us
as a haven of repose, fortress and palace and garden in
one.&nbsp; But all this requires description.</p>
<p>Shustar from the river is extraordinarily like Dizful.&nbsp;
The Karker&iacute;a, on which it stands, is the Diz over again,
but I think a larger river; and there is a stone bridge
apparently of the same date.&nbsp; The bridge of Shustar is a
fine work.&nbsp; It is the broadest I have ever seen out of
Europe, for one might drive a coach across it but for the holes;
and it is quite fifty feet high above the water.&nbsp; The most
singular feature of it is that it is built in a zigzag, and that
it has immense piers to the buttresses, some of which seem to
have held waterwheels.&nbsp; The parapet is very low, and the
whole thing so much out of repair, that crossing it as we did, in
a hurricane of wind, we were rather nervous about the
camels.&nbsp; Below it is an immense weir, over which the river
falls with a deafening roar.&nbsp; A fine arched gateway shuts it
off from the city, and just above stands the castle, where we
are.</p>
<p>Shustar seems a larger town than Dizful, but it is said to be
less flourishing.&nbsp; They both have great empty spaces within
the walls, and plenty of ruins.&nbsp; <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>The kalat is an immense rambling
place, enclosing a number of different buildings.&nbsp; First,
there are rows of vaulted buildings, intended probably for
barracks, with a large outer court, full just now of green
pasture, a sort of mallow, on which we have turned our camels out
to graze.&nbsp; These outbuildings are two storeys high, with
loop-holes to shoot out of.&nbsp; From the outer court a paved
causeway leads up to a narrow gate, the entrance of an inner
castle, built round a large square court, with trees and
flower-beds in the middle.&nbsp; From this again a flight of
fifteen steps leads up to a terrace, garden, and pavilion three
storeys high.&nbsp; This last is the hammam, and is the building
specially placed at our disposal.&nbsp; The Shahzade is absent,
and the only inhabitants of his kalat are a garrison of about a
dozen soldiers, but they live in the outer circle of buildings,
and will not disturb us.&nbsp; The prince-governor&rsquo;s
absence is a disadvantage to us, although we profit by it to
inhabit his house, for our letters are to him, and we do not know
what sort of wakil he has left here.&nbsp; To-day, however, we
have seen nobody, and have been very happy and content in the
coolness and peace of all around.&nbsp; Only the river makes a
distant roar, far below, for from the terrace one looks sheer
down at least eighty feet to the water.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 8.&mdash;This spot is like a thing in a fairy
tale.&nbsp; Our pavilion contains several rooms on the
ground-floor, grouped round a central piece where <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>there is a
fountain; and above this is a gallery with more empty rooms round
it.&nbsp; We live on the ground-floor, and our windows open on to
a narrow terrace with a low stone parapet, from which one can
throw a stone down into the river.&nbsp; The Karkeria makes a
sharp bend just above Shustar, round what looks like the most
beautiful park, a level greensward with immense dark green shady
trees, standing as if planted for ornament.&nbsp; Here we sit,
and late in the evening and early in the morning I see a pair of
pelicans swimming or flying below.&nbsp; The terrace communicates
with the garden, which is gay with poppies, pink and lilac and
white, in full bloom.&nbsp; There is a little tank, and a row of
stunted palm-trees, where rollers, green and blue birds like
jays, sit, while swifts dart about catching mosquitoes and flies,
only a few hundred, alas, out of the millions that torment
us.&nbsp; For there is no rose without a thorn, nor is this
lovely kiosk and garden full of blooming poppies without its
plague.&nbsp; The flies and mosquitoes are maddening, and to-day
the heat of summer has burst upon us.&nbsp; After a hot night,
the day dawned hotter still, and a sultry wind blew up dark
clouds, till now the sky is black all round.</p>
<p>Towards evening we had thunder and lightning, but hardly a
drop of rain; and to-night the air is heavy as lead.&nbsp; I am
getting anxious now about the heat.&nbsp; I wish we could get
away, either to the hills or the sea but I fear we shall be
detained <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>some days.&nbsp; The storm has prevented the
Shahzade&rsquo;s wakil from paying us the visit he announced this
morning, and we cannot even prepare to go on without seeing him;
we are, in fact, dependent on his assistance.&nbsp; We sent him
our letter for the Shahzade early this morning, and Hajji
Mohammed brought back word that he was coming immediately; but we
have been waiting all day, and he has not come.&nbsp; What is
still more tiresome is the unfortunate circumstance that no
letter has come for us from the British Consul at Bussora.&nbsp;
This puts us into an awkward position; we had given out that we
expected the letter, and it is worse to say that one expects such
a letter and not to get it, than never to have mentioned it.</p>
<p>Several visitors have been to see us, two or three merchants,
a doctor, and others; they all, on hearing we had not received
the countenance we had expected, looked on us somewhat
doubtfully, in spite of our talking about our letter of
recommendation to the Shahzade.&nbsp; However, we shall see what
the wakil says to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 10.&mdash;This is the evening of our fourth day
at Shustar, and we are not absolutely sure of starting, though we
hope to get away to-morrow morning. . . .&nbsp; Yesterday was a
wretched day.&nbsp; The night before last Wilfrid was suddenly
taken ill, and though the attack has now passed off, it has left
him weak.&nbsp; A serious indisposition makes all minor
difficulties seem trifles; but these become <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>important
when they cause delay, and we have been in much trouble about
getting servants.</p>
<p>This town life is certainly not healthy in the great heat (and
summer has come upon us in earnest); and every day wasted will
make travelling more difficult, and the heat greater.&nbsp; We
hope, however, that we have settled all with the governor, but
until we are actually off I shall not be at ease.</p>
<p>The wakil has reluctantly promised us an escort for Bebahan,
protesting that the country between it and Shustar is so unsafe,
that he cannot guarantee our safety, but he may at the last
moment recall his promise.&nbsp; And we are still without a
servant, except a little man who takes the camels out to graze in
the morning, and brings them home at night.&nbsp; This little man
says he will go with us, but I doubt his doing so when the moment
comes; so many people have offered their services and then backed
out, amongst them the so-called &ldquo;Sheykh&rdquo; Mohammed,
our acquaintance of the mill and not a sheykh at all, only a
zellem of Chaab extraction, and a householder of Shustar.&nbsp;
But we do not like him, nor any of the candidates, except two
soldiers, and these we cannot have, as they belong to the small
garrison of the kalat, and the governor refuses to give them
leave.</p>
<p>The governor has been very suspicious of us, and thrown all
the obstacles he could in our way.&nbsp; He came yesterday,
fortunately not till Wilfrid was better and able to receive him,
and was evidently <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>indisposed to further our wishes.&nbsp; His manner,
though extremely polite, showed that he was determined we should
go to Ahwas, not Bebahan.&nbsp; He strongly urged us to give up
all notion of taking the Bebahan road; the country was unsafe; no
escort short of a thousand men would suffice to get us through,
and that number he had not at his disposal; and besides, we
should be wanting in respect to the Shahzade if we did not go and
present our letter to him; we were really bound to go to Ahwas,
where we should find him.&nbsp; As to a letter from the English
balioz (consul) at Bussora, no such communication had been
received; and he the wakil, knew nothing about us.&nbsp; He could
only repeat that he would do nothing for us except forward us to
Ahwas.&nbsp; He positively refused an escort for any other
object.</p>
<p>Things were in this position when the wakil left, and we were
at our wits&rsquo; end, when fortunately, a young gentleman
called who belongs to the telegraph office, Mirza Ali Mohammed,
of Shiraz, &ldquo;captain of telegraphs,&rdquo; who talks a
little Arabic, and a little French.&nbsp; It then occurred to
Wilfrid to telegraph to the Legation at Teheran, requesting that
the government there should be asked to order the wakil of
Shustar to give us an escort to Bebahan.&nbsp; The captain of
telegraphs carried off this message, which he had written and
translated into Persian for us, and the money for its
transmission; but this morning he returned <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the money,
with news that the telegram could not be sent.&nbsp; The fact is
he dared not send it without informing his superior, who declined
to let it go.&nbsp; But it has had its effect.&nbsp; The governor
has no pretext now for doubting our respectability, for
suspicious characters would not want to communicate with the
central government at Teheran.&nbsp; So instead of a thousand, we
are to have an escort of six men and a sergeant to accompany us
to Bebahan.&nbsp; It has been unwillingly granted, and I shall
not be surprised if it should even yet be withdrawn.</p>
<p><i>Later</i>.&mdash;There seems to have been a storm
somewhere; the air is clear, and we hope for less oppressive
weather.&nbsp; But the foretaste of heat we have had, is a
warning.&nbsp; We have talked over our plans, and agreed to give
up all idea of pushing on to Bender Abbas, and to be satisfied
with reaching Bushire.&nbsp; There can be no difficulty in
finding Captain Cameron, for he will be obliged to pass between
Bebahan and the sea, but we must make haste or he will have
crossed our line before we can get to the coast.&nbsp; His
intention was to keep as near to the coast as possible, so that
we ought to meet him near or at Bender Dilam.</p>
<p>Three or four respectable merchants of Shustar have waited
upon us this evening, and given us much friendly advice about the
dangers of travel in which we do not much believe.&nbsp; They
shook their heads when Wilfrid remarked, that surely under the
administration of the Shahzade and his excellent <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>wakil, the
country must be safe, and assured us that the wakil was perfectly
justified in dissuading us from our undertaking.&nbsp; It would
be much safer to go to Ahwas.&nbsp; Another, Hajji Abdallah, had
with him a letter in English from an English firm at Bushire,
which he begged us to translate.&nbsp; It was far from
complimentary, and we had some difficulty in disguising it under
a form of Arabic politeness.&nbsp; He, too, was loud in his
dissuasion of our journey.</p>
<p>Our visitors shewed no sign of going away, and I believe they
would have sat on all through the night talking, had we not
dismissed them.&nbsp; Hajji Abdallah&rsquo;s last words were an
entreaty to reconsider our decision, and abandon the foolish plan
of going to Bebahan.&nbsp; He has once been that way he says, and
would not for the world go again; there are not only dangerous
wild tribes, but mountain passes and impassable rocks.&nbsp; We
listened unmoved, and in fact we had no choice.</p>

escort&mdash;The Shah&rsquo;s Arab subjects&mdash;Ram Hormuz and

villages&mdash;How they collect taxes in
Persia&mdash;Bebahan.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>April</i> 11.&mdash;It would be easy to
quote unlucky starts on Fridays, and I am afraid this is
one.&nbsp; Wilfrid is ill again, a passing fatigue we hope, from
loading the camels this morning in the hot sun, and riding all
day long in it.&nbsp; He is lying down now in the tent and trying
to rest, but the flies are intolerable.</p>
<p>Our plan in leaving Shustar was to go with our escort, seven
soldiers on foot, armed six with matchlocks and one with a
narghileh, to Ram Hormuz, a small town eighty miles on the road
to Bebahan, and there get a reinforcement from the Ferraz-bashi
or deputy governor of the place for the other eighty miles.&nbsp;
This sounded well enough, but already our escort has deserted us,
and we are alone.</p>
<p>After delays of all sorts, for till the moment of starting we
were still without servants, we got our camels loaded, and about
ten o&rsquo;clock rode out of the <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>palace gate and through the streets
of Shustar, and over a stone bridge, which spans the second of
the two branches of the river on which the town stands, and into
the open country beyond.&nbsp; It was terribly hot, and the whole
country is a plague of flies, which buzz about one all day long,
and settle on one&rsquo;s head at night.</p>
<p>Our camels have profited by the mallows in the court of the
palace to such an extent that they are all fat and frisky, and we
had some trouble in loading them.&nbsp; But, at the last moment,
we had an unexpected offer of assistance.&nbsp; A young Arab,
dressed in a green calico jibbeh, suddenly appeared upon the
scene, and volunteered his services.&nbsp; He had a pleasant
face, so that we were taken with him at once.&nbsp; He told us
that he was a native of some village on the Tigris near Bagdad,
and that he had been impressed by the Turks for their navy, in
which he had served three years, that he had then managed to
desert while in port at Bussorah, and had fled across the border
to Mohamrah.&nbsp; He had since earned his bread by working as
horse-keeper for one of the Bawiyeh sheykhs, and later, tiring of
that, in service with different Persians at Shustar.&nbsp; His
idea now, was to get down to the sea once more, and he begged us
to take him with us to Bushire.&nbsp; By accident Hajji Mohammed
knew something of some of his relations at Bagdad, and as such a
person was exactly what we most wanted, we accepted him at once,
on his own terms.&nbsp; This young <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>fellow&rsquo;s coming has been an
advantage to us in more ways than one, for it had the immediate
effect of inducing another of the crowd who were witnessing our
departure to volunteer, and a little red-haired Persian in blue
frock and trowsers, came forward to enlist in our service.&nbsp;
Thus we are no longer wholly dependent on our old cavass and on
ourselves.</p>
<p>As soon as we were outside the town, our sergeant and the six
soldiers began to give themselves airs of military importance,
advancing in front of us in skirmishing order, and enjoining us
to keep close together, although the country had a quite
peaceable appearance, the road much frequented by country people
on donkeys, unarmed and peaceable folks.&nbsp; The track led
through undulating ground chiefly barren, here and there a patch
of cultivation, often between high banks.&nbsp; Our brave
defenders here shewed their zeal by running up to the tops of the
steepest and highest of these banks, firing off their guns at
random, generally in the air, but one of the shots hit a lizard
sitting in its hole.&nbsp; Their energy, however, cooled as the
heat increased; and towards noon, they were satisfied to trudge
along with only an occasional diversion to look out for
enemies.&nbsp; By a quarter to one o&rsquo;clock, they all seemed
tired, and we too were glad to halt for three quarters of an
hour, under a large shady canora tree, in the midst of a field of
oats.&nbsp; Here we ate our luncheon, while the animals fed on
the oats.&nbsp; <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>Wilfrid complained a little of the sun, but it was not
till we had gone on again for a couple of hours that he
acknowledged he felt really ill.&nbsp; We were just turning off
the track to the north, to go to the tents of a certain Hassan
Khan, known to the soldiers, when he said he could have gone no
further.&nbsp; The tents were not a mile from the road, but
getting there was almost too much for him.&nbsp; We found them
set in a circular enclosure, fenced in by a hedge of branches,
like a new made Sussex fence, and evidently intended to last
longer than a true Bedouin camp ever does.&nbsp; Here there are
about a dozen small tents, half hair, half matting.&nbsp; Outside
the enclosure, a few mares and foals grazing, among them one
rather nice filly, Wadneh Hursan they say, and animals of all
sorts, cows, sheep, and goats have been brought inside the hedge
for the night.</p>
<p>Wilfrid is extremely tired.&nbsp; The rest seems to have done
him no good.&nbsp; He complains of his head and of pains all
over.&nbsp; I hope fatigue and the heat are sufficient to account
for his feeling ill.&nbsp; I dread a return of the attack he had
at Shustar.&nbsp; I wish we had not left the town.&nbsp; This is
a forlorn spot to be ill in, and though at Shustar we should be
no better off, as far as concerns getting out of the country,
there would be a few more comforts, and a chance of sending for
help to Bussora.&nbsp; If he gets worse we shall be in an almost
hopeless position.&nbsp; Every place seems frightfully far off
the moment there is a difficulty about moving; to get back to <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>Shustar
would be almost as impracticable as to go on to Ram Hormuz.&nbsp;
Seven hours&rsquo; travelling seems now an impassable gulf.&nbsp;
I have arranged a sort of mosquito net for Wilfrid against the
flies, but it only keeps them out for a time, and then a few
manage to get inside it, and it has all to be rearranged.&nbsp;
But now it is nearly sundown, and the flies will go to sleep at
dark; and if the night is cool he may get some sleep.</p>
<p>Everybody here is fortunately kind.&nbsp; Hassan Khan, the
chief, is away at Shustar, but his brother Kambar Aga received us
well.&nbsp; He has good manners, speaks Arabic pretty fairly, and
has been telling me about his tribe, a section of the Bawiyeh of
Ajjem, as distinguished from the Bawiyeh of the Ottoman
dominions.&nbsp; The people and their chief seem to be very
poor.&nbsp; Kambar professes himself ready to accompany us
to-morrow to another camp not far off, and on our line of march,
that of Hajji Salman, an Arabic-speaking tribe; this is
fortunate, as our escort has deserted.&nbsp; They probably never
meant to come further than this, but however that may be, they
have in fact abandoned us and gone home to Shustar.&nbsp; In the
middle of the day, while we were sitting under the canora tree,
they demanded money, and Hajji Mohammed foolishly, without asking
us, gave them as much as they ought to have had for the whole
journey to Ram Hormuz, and as a consequence, having secured their
pay, and with no further motive for taking trouble they
departed.&nbsp; Their <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>company is no loss, they were
disagreeable and tiresome, but they were of value as a mark of
government protection, and in that respect it is unfortunate that
they have left us.</p>
<p>Escort or no escort I care not, if only Wilfrid would get
better, and he seems no better.</p>
<p><i>Saturday evening</i>, <i>April</i> 12.&mdash;Wilfrid
alarmingly ill all night.&nbsp; He got rapidly worse, and then
seemed unconscious of all around; it seemed hopeless, but now he
has rallied, and I think the worst is over.&nbsp; Still I have
made up my mind not to look beyond the necessity of the moment,
and indeed these twenty-four hours blot out past and
future.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why I write a journal.&nbsp; He
cannot sit up yet, though he says he shall be able to travel
to-night.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what to think, but the wish to
move is something gained; a short time ago he could hardly speak,
and if he really has turned the corner, a few hours may make a
great difference.&nbsp; He now says that by travelling at night
only, he shall be able to go on.</p>
<p>Ghada, our new Arab, has behaved very well.&nbsp; I hardly
know what I should have done without him to keep the fire up all
night, and help to make medicines and beef-tea.&nbsp; In the
evening and night I tried everything I could think of out of our
small stock of medicines, and in vain.&nbsp; The sun rose and
blazed fiercely, and the flies swarmed as before.&nbsp; But in
the afternoon the illness took another turn, and now, at any
rate, the danger seems to be past.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>To
please Wilfrid, though I doubt his being able to travel, I have
packed up everything and got the tents down, and each separate
load put ready; for to carry out the plan of night-travelling, we
must load after dark, that is, by the light of a very small moon,
when it rises about one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We are then to be
off, Wilfrid to ride his del&uacute;l, and we are to get as far
as we can; I have got cold tea and beef-tea in bottles, to be
accessible at any moment.&nbsp; He has remained lying down on his
rugs and pillow, the only things not yet packed, which, when the
time comes, will be put on his del&uacute;l.</p>
<p>Kambar Aga and his tribe are good people.&nbsp; Nothing could
be kinder than they have been.&nbsp; Hassan Khan has sent a third
brother from Shustar, Aga Ibrahim, who is to accompany us with
six of his men to Hajji Salman&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 13.&mdash;Wilfrid was able to travel for four
hours, and though much exhausted seems really none the
worse.&nbsp; We reached the Salamat camp about six this
morning.&nbsp; We hope to set out presently&mdash;about
sunset.</p>
<p>The moon rose last night towards one o&rsquo;clock, but owing
to the slowness of everybody the loading took more than an
hour.&nbsp; They all wanted to wait till the moon should be high
in the sky before starting.&nbsp; We first struck across the
plain of pasture and scrub to get back to the track, and then
pursued our way along it eastwards.&nbsp; At half-past <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>five we saw
some tents to the south, but these our guides said were the wrong
ones.&nbsp; An hour later met two zellems, who told us the
contrary, but too late for us to return; and they added that they
came from a camp of Salamat Arabs an hour or so further
east.&nbsp; It was already hot, but we pushed on, the road good
and level, splendid pasture, hills to the left, an interminable
plain in front and to the right, extending to the Karkeria and
beyond it.&nbsp; Some tents were pointed out to us, said to be on
the opposite bank of the river.&nbsp; We reached the Salamat
camp, Sheykh Abeyeh, at eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>A few fairly good-looking but very small mares are to be
seen.&nbsp; The camp has been evidently on the spot for weeks,
and is accordingly unsavoury, more like a village than a
camp.</p>
<p>We have, or rather had, for I write while waiting to start,
our tent on a small tell separated by a dip in the ground from
the Salamat encampment.&nbsp; The ground here is covered with a
horrid little spiked grass, like miniature barley to look at,
which pricks through everything.&nbsp; Its barbed thorns are like
fish-hooks, very difficult to extract, and all our clothes and
bedding are full of them.</p>
<p>Wilfrid spent the day lying down in the tent, able to talk
though tired.&nbsp; The people here are not ill-bred, and they
have even been kind to us.&nbsp; Their Sheykh, Abeyeh, with
several of his friends, and relations, came to see us soon after
our arrival.&nbsp; Abeyeh told us that his tribe belongs to the
<a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>Ahl
es-Shimal, and he knows all about the tribes of the Ham&aacute;d
and their horses.&nbsp; His brother Rashid showed us a very
beautiful grey colt, which he offered to exchange for our hamra
mare, who is suffering from a sore back.&nbsp; The colt is too
young, or might have been worth taking; the owner says he would
not part with it but that the Shahzade has intimated an intention
of buying it.&nbsp; The Shahzade is, it seems, in the habit of
purchasing all the good-looking horses he hears of, and does not
pay for them, but he does not take mares; this, at least, is the
tale told to us.&nbsp; Our mare, though thoroughbred, is in such
wretched condition that the Shahzade would hardly care to seize
her.</p>
<p>Abeyeh readily agreed to escort us to Ram Hormuz with six
khayal, Rashid proposed to accompany us on foot as camel driver,
and Aga Ibrahim (from Hassan Khan&rsquo;s), also offers to go
on.&nbsp; It is five o&rsquo;clock, time to pack.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Wilfrid felt so ill an hour ago
that all these arrangements seemed to be vain.&nbsp; But he is
better, and now we are off.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 14.&mdash;Our new plan of travelling by night
seems to answer well.&nbsp; Wilfrid was able to go on from nine
till five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He is recovering, though reduced
to the extreme of thinness.&nbsp; The heat during the day is
insufferable, and even if there had been no cause of anxiety, we
could hardly have continued marching by day.&nbsp; The flies are
intolerable, they follow us, and are found <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>everywhere;
at night when we are riding they are sitting in swarms upon our
heads, and if driven off, perch again in spite of darkness.&nbsp;
However, in the dark they are quiet unless disturbed, which is
some small relief.&nbsp; Last night our track went a good deal up
and down, crossing small ravines and watercourses, and pools and
ditches full of water.&nbsp; Sometimes we waded through tall
grass, splendid stuff, growing quite wild and uncared for.&nbsp;
The moon serves us hardly at all, but we could see dimly by
starlight.&nbsp; The constellation of the Scorpion is now our
guide, rising as it does in the south-east.&nbsp; I have slept
little lately, and once last night I fell fast asleep on
horseback, and woke with a start at a sound of munching.&nbsp; It
was my mare grazing eagerly knee-deep in wild oats.&nbsp; Where
the camels were I could not see, but heard them soon afterwards
some way off ahead.&nbsp; Wilfrid bore up as long as he could,
till at five o&rsquo;clock he said he could not go a yard
further, and we camped for the day, pitching the tent on a tell
commanding all surrounding tells.&nbsp; Our escort objected to
this halt.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Shirazi will come down from those
hills and rob us,&rdquo; said Abeyeh, &ldquo;and the town of Ram
Hormuz is only three or four hours further.&nbsp; Let us go
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; His objection was natural; this is very exposed
ground, and close to us on the north rises a range of crags, from
which the Shirazi robbers may be watching us.&nbsp; But perched
on the tell we get a little air, and this is worth some
risk.&nbsp; Besides, they have not come <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>yet, and we
shall he gone presently.&nbsp; Abeyeh argued in vain; if there
had been legions of robbers in sight, I don&rsquo;t think Wilfrid
would have moved.&nbsp; He was indeed unfit to stir, and has been
lying on the ground under the shade of the tent ever since.&nbsp;
A halt like this is not much of a rest; the heat is too
overpowering, the flies too troublesome.&nbsp; Beyond the rocky
range we see high snow peaks, very tantalising in this furnace,
and looking the other way, there is just below us a fine piece of
meadow land on the banks of a running stream.&nbsp; In all the
hollows there is rich pasture.&nbsp; Abeyeh and his men have kept
a good look-out, some posted about on heights, and the rest
watching the mares hobbled, and turned loose to graze.</p>
<p>It is four o&rsquo;clock; the heat lessening, and Wilfrid says
he is ready to go on.&nbsp; We must pack.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><i>April</i> 15.&mdash;We have at last reached Ram Hormuz, or
as it is pronounced &ldquo;Ramuz.&rdquo;&nbsp; We left our
bivouac on the tell at five o&rsquo;clock yesterday
afternoon.&nbsp; Wilfrid tried riding on horseback, but found the
effort too great, and had to give it up and mount his
del&uacute;l.&nbsp; Our way lay through more long grass, and
ditches, and water.&nbsp; I, as sleepy as the night before, was
constantly dozing off and waking suddenly in the middle of some
long dream, unable to remember where I was.&nbsp; There is
nothing so painful as this struggle with sleep, and it lasted all
night long.&nbsp; At last we came suddenly in sight of some camp
fires about half a mile away to our right, <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>and Abeyeh,
fearing to advance further, ordered a halt.&nbsp; There was
danger, he said, in coming on an encampment unawares, lest we
should be taken for enemies.&nbsp; We did not stop to argue, but
with delight obeyed, and in a few minutes were sound asleep upon
the ground&mdash;nor did we wake till day was already
breaking.</p>
<p>A discussion now arose what further was to be done.&nbsp; The
tents, we were informed, belonged to the Khamis, an Arab tribe,
half Bedouin, half fellah, and Abeyeh was for spending the day
with them.&nbsp; But the sound sleep had done Wilfrid good, and
as it grew light we could see the palm groves of Ram Hormuz,
apparently ten miles off, and we knew that there we should get
refuge from the sun.&nbsp; So leaving the rest to follow or not
as they would&mdash;we got on our horses and started at a gallop,
Shiekha and Sayad bounding on in front of us delighted at this
unexpected run.&nbsp; At first there was no road, and we got
entangled in a series of watercourses, but scrambling through
these we reached a footpath where the going was good, and
presently overtook a party of Arabs, men and women, riding in on
donkeys to market at the town.&nbsp; They all expressed
themselves much pleased to see us, taking us to be Arabs like
themselves, and here in Persia they always seem delighted to meet
their countrymen.&nbsp; They pointed us out the town, for there
was more than one grove of palms, and in the mirage which hid
everything as the sun rose, we had lost <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>sight of
it.&nbsp; At half-past six we stopped at the ferraz-bashi&rsquo;s
door, and in another minute were sitting in a cool court-yard
under the shade of a wall, waiting till the respectable
functionary, our host, had finished his devotions.</p>
<p>On the sight of our letters from the governor of Shustar he
made us very welcome&mdash;conversing through the medium of his
secretary, who knows Arabic.&nbsp; Carpets were brought, and tea
made&mdash;the most delicious draught we ever tasted in our
lives&mdash;flavoured with orange and some acid fruit.&nbsp; The
gallop has cured Wilfrid, and he says he shall not be ill
again.</p>
<p>Our caravan having arrived, we have moved outside the town,
for the ferraz-bashi&rsquo;s house is not big enough to hold us
all, and are encamped on a little mound overlooking the gardens
which skirt Ram Hormuz.&nbsp; I wish I could describe the beauty
of this place.&nbsp; Round us lie a few acres of green wheat, in
which quails and francolins are calling, and through which a
little stream of running water winds.&nbsp; Close by, on another
mound, stands a beautiful little kubbr, the tomb of some saint,
and on either side gardens half run wild, a delicious tangle of
pomegranate, fig, and vine, with here and there lemon and peach,
and groups of palm.&nbsp; The pomegranates now are in full
flower, and so are the roses, and every thicket is alive with
nightingales.&nbsp; It is nearly sunset, and groups of
blue-gowned Persians are coming across the fields from the town,
<a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>to wash
and say their prayers at the stream and the kubbr.&nbsp; The town
itself is half hidden in the gardens, but shows picturesquely
through, backed by a range of crimson hills, scored and lined
with blue shadows.&nbsp; We have been following the edge of these
hills all the way from Shustar.&nbsp; They are the same which are
supposed to hold the Shirazi robbers our Arab escort feared so
much.</p>
<p>The position of the Arabs here is a miserable one.&nbsp; At
war with these Shirazi, and pillaged by the Government which does
nothing to protect them, they still cling to their little bits of
cultivation wherever there is water near the hills.&nbsp; They
are half the year nomadic, going south and west with the flocks,
but in the spring return to the hills, plough up a few acres, and
gather in a crop if possible before the tax-gatherer has found
them out.&nbsp; The Persian Government is weak, and the garrison
of Ram Hormuz is generally only sufficient for its duty of
holding the town, but every now and then a reinforcement arrives
from Ahwas or Fellahieh and then a raid is made under pretext of
a collection of arrears, and horses and cattle are driven off in
payment.&nbsp; This seems to be the plan throughout the
province.&nbsp; We asked Abeyeh and the Khamis Sheykh who came
with him to-day to our camp, why they put themselves into this
government trap by coming to the hills, when they might remain
unmolested in the plain, or go where they would.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is the soil,&rdquo; they exclaimed, <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>&ldquo;the soil which is so
rich.&nbsp; Where should we find another like it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Indeed, the whole of this side of Persia seems meant to be a
garden.&nbsp; Unlike the plains of Bagdad, which never can have
been cultivated except with irrigation, the land here grows crops
as in Europe, watered by the rain from heaven.&nbsp; The range of
Bactiari hills by attracting clouds gives it this rare
advantage.</p>
<p>Ram Hormuz itself must have been a great city once.&nbsp; Its
position at a point where several rivers meet, and at the foot of
a gorge, leading through the mountains to Shiraz, makes it
naturally a place of importance, but it is little more now than a
market for the Bedouin tribes and a military station.</p>
<p>The ferraz-bashi has been very amiable to us, though, like
everyone else, averse to our further progress in the direction of
Bebahan.&nbsp; The road, he says, is most unsafe, every village
at war with its neighbour, and he dares not send troops with us
even if he had them.&nbsp; There is, however, in the town, a
certain potentate of the district first to be traversed, one
Mohammed Jafar, Khan of the village of Sultanabad, who can
protect us if any one can.&nbsp; To him we are to be recommended,
and perhaps he will go on with us to-morrow.&nbsp; Abeyeh and his
men, alas, can go no further.&nbsp; They are Arabs, and honest
men, and camel drivers, and we have bid them good-bye with
regret.&nbsp; But the people further on are Persian, and Persian
and <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>Arabian are everywhere at odds.&nbsp; The idea is not
agreeable of plunging into a hornet&rsquo;s nest, such as the
country beyond us is described to be, but there is no help for
it; to return is impossible.&nbsp; Every day becomes more and
more fearfully hot, and our only hope now is the sea.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 16.&mdash;We are refreshed by a good
night&rsquo;s rest, such as we have not had since leaving
Shustar.&nbsp; The ferraz-bashi called again this morning,
walking out in the cool of sunrise, with a rose in his hand, to
pay us his compliment.&nbsp; It seems to be the fashion among the
Persians to go about with flowers, which they present to each
other as polite offerings, and just now it is the season of
roses.&nbsp; His Excellency informed us that Ka&iuml;d Mohammed
Jafar would be ready to start for Sultanabad at the asr (about
half past three), so we have made all our preparations for
departure.&nbsp; Although the heat has been great, 96&deg; at
coolest, I have managed to make a sketch of Ram Hormuz, but
nothing can do justice to its beauty.&nbsp; We have been more
pleasantly received here, than anywhere else in Persia, and I
feel sure we might make friends with the people if only we could
speak their language.&nbsp; Travelling without knowing the
language, is like walking with one&rsquo;s eyes shut.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 17.&mdash;Mohammed Jafar arrived soon after four,
and immediately we started.&nbsp; It was of importance that no
time should be lost, for we had a river to cross, the Jerrahi
which comes down <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>here from the mountains, and runs into the Persian
Gulf, at Fellahieh.&nbsp; The country, till we came to it, was a
difficult one for camels, being a very network of irrigation,
with the channels crossed by treacherous little bridges.&nbsp;
But the camels managed it all without accident.&nbsp; The river,
of which we crossed two branches, flows over a bed of gravel, and
was nowhere over our horses&rsquo; girths.&nbsp; The water very
cold, with melted snow, so that a delicious breeze of iced air
followed the current.&nbsp; It was now past sundown, and we were
anxious to be clear of the inclosed ground, before it should be
absolutely night; but the Ka&iuml;d, tiresome man, had made an
arrangement with some friends at a little village beyond the
river to dine with them, and then go on in the night, a plan
which did not at all suit us.&nbsp; Indeed it was impossible for
us, with our camels, to halt in such a spot, where we could not
have prevented them trampling the standing corn, and where we
should have been helpless after dark.&nbsp; So declining, as
politely as we could, the hospitality offered, we left the
Ka&iuml;d to take his meal with his four horsemen, and pushed on
alone.&nbsp; A villager was sent to show us the way, for we were
not a mile from open ground, and night was falling and every
minute precious, and we were resolved to reach it if we
could.&nbsp; Road, however, it soon appeared there was none, for
to reach the village, the Ka&iuml;d had taken us away from the
main path, and as it grew darker we got more and more <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>entangled,
in dykes and ditches.&nbsp; At one moment things seemed almost
hopeless with us, a deep canal barring all further progress, and
the villager who had brought us to this pass, profiting by the
confusion, having run away.&nbsp; Fortunately Wilfrid perceived
this flight in time, and riding after him fired his pistol in the
air, and brought him back, when, under the compulsion of fear, he
showed us where to cross.&nbsp; It was a poor ford, and some of
the loads got wet, but beyond it we were on hard ground, and able
now to wait in patience till the Ka&iuml;d and his men should
come.&nbsp; Our shot seemed to have disturbed their feast, and we
had not long to wait.&nbsp; Then we marched on in silence and
utter darkness, but over a good road, till half-past one in this
morning, when a loud barking of dogs announced our arrival at
Sultanabad.</p>
<p>Here the Ka&iuml;d has a house to which he at once retired,
leaving us to lie down in our cloaks, with our camels and horses,
till daylight.&nbsp; He would willingly have invited us in, but
we dare not leave our beasts and property, and now we have
pitched our tent for the day, looping it up as usual, like an
umbrella, to get every breath of air.&nbsp; When day dawned, we
saw the Ka&iuml;d&rsquo;s house on one side of us, with three big
canora trees overshadowing its entrance, and a walled garden at
the back of it; on the other side the village with its barley
fields and splendid grass crops.&nbsp; The houses of the village,
built of sun-dried brick, are in a cluster together, <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>about two
hundred yards from our mound; in front of them two or three black
tents.&nbsp; The Ka&iuml;d&rsquo;s house is of considerable size,
and appears to contain several court-yards.&nbsp; Sultanabad is
itself a poor, mean-looking place, but if Hajji Mohammed is to be
believed, a very nest of brigands, any one of whom for one single
kran would kill a man, a real stronghold of robbers, and as such
keeping the neighbouring country in terror.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t know what to think, for Hajji Mohammed believes every
tale he hears, and the horsemen have been cramming him all the
way along with stories of Mohammed Jafar&rsquo;s exploits, to
enhance their chief&rsquo;s importance.&nbsp; How he does what he
likes in the teeth of the government, who dare not punish him for
having killed several of the Shahzade&rsquo;s people only a
couple of years ago, how only he and his Sultanabadis can travel
safely on the Bebahan road; and one can hardly blame poor Hajji
Mohammed for expecting us to lead him into mischief, for we have
before done so, and he thinks us reckless of danger.&nbsp; He is
always lecturing us on prudence, though he himself is an odd
combination of caution and rashness; he once at a critical moment
wanted to stuff his revolver into an inaccessible bag, merely
because the strap of the belt belonging to it was broken; another
time he would have given his gun to a stranger to carry, had we
not prevented his doing so.&nbsp; We spent this morning drinking
tea and eating eggs and butter and a kid, and spreading wet <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>things to
dry.&nbsp; Fortunately no serious damage has been done, and the
fierce sun soon dried everything.&nbsp; A breeze sprang up, too,
which helped the drying, and drove away the flies.</p>
<p>Hajji Mohammed was commissioned in the course of the morning
to negotiate terms with the Ka&iuml;d, who had been already
sounding the cavass as to how much money could be got from
us.&nbsp; He has really done it very well, and arranged that at
Bebahan we are to pay the Ka&iuml;d one hundred krans.&nbsp; The
great man at first asked for an abba or a cashmere shawl, but
here Hajji Mohammed seems to have spoken with proper
firmness.</p>
<p>We want to start at half-past four, and ought to pack now, but
the servants are dawdling over the remains of the kid; they will
not move till they have devoured the last morsel.&nbsp; Besides,
they have got several girths to mend before we can load.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 18.&mdash;We had a great deal of trouble to start
at all yesterday afternoon, and after a difficult march we have
got no farther than the village of Jaz&ucirc;n, about fifteen
miles, which was reached at five <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> this morning.&nbsp; At this rate we
shall be a month getting to Bebahan, especially if the pass over
the range of rocky hills we must cross, is as rugged as report
says.</p>
<p>It turned out that the Ka&iuml;d himself did not intend to
start with us, but to send his nephew with four people on foot,
and follow himself with the four horsemen.&nbsp; He stood by as
we loaded, and <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>then wished us good evening.&nbsp; When all was ready
he asked us the favour to take with us a bundle of brown wool for
Bebahan, and as it was not heavy we agreed.&nbsp; While Wilfrid
turned to look at this package, a villager took the rifle off his
del&uacute;l, but hastily put it back on Wilfrid&rsquo;s shouting
&ldquo;Stop thief,&rdquo; and ran off accompanied by the little
crowd which had gathered round us, no doubt equally guilty at
heart, and expecting blows.&nbsp; Then we started&mdash;it was
about half-past five, a fine evening with a breeze, which, alas,
died away at sunset, after which for two hours the air was
extremely sultry.&nbsp; The Sultanabad field crops had to be
crossed, but they were on dry land, with only a few easy
ditches.&nbsp; Then we came to ground like a park, formerly
cultivated, but now abandoned to nature; canora trees dotted
about like handsome hawthorn trees, as if planted for ornament,
the grass all crops run wild, splendid oats and barley now in the
ear.&nbsp; Here and there an abandoned village, the walls
gleaming red in the setting sun.&nbsp; Some of these were
inhabited not very long since, and we were told various tales
regarding them; from one place the inhabitants had gone away of
their own accord quite lately to escape the tax-gatherer&rsquo;s
next visit, leaving their corn standing; from another they had
been driven by fire and sword, the soldiers burning the village
after sacking it.</p>
<p>After about two hours we crossed the river Abn&rsquo;l <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>Faris; it
is not many yards wide nor is it deep, but the banks are steep
and overgrown with trees and thick bushes.&nbsp; A narrow and
nearly perpendicular path leads down to the ford.&nbsp; The
camels have become skilful, and managed the scramble admirably;
Shakran now carries our personal baggage, he has completely
recovered, and is the cleverest of them all.&nbsp; Hajji Mohammed
sat imperturbable on Wilfrid&rsquo;s del&uacute;l, and nearly got
his head caught in the tangle of branches.&nbsp; After this we
had another water or two to cross in the dark, the approaches to
which were always announced by the croaking of frogs; then the
chirping of grasshoppers replaced the croaking, and we were again
on hard ground, the country a good deal up and down and broken up
into ravines and fissures caused by rains.&nbsp; At ten
o&rsquo;clock, as far as we could make out by starlight, we were
on good flat pasture land, real pasture not crops, and trees
growing in groups as in a park, with a low ridge on the
left.&nbsp; Here we halted for an hour to eat, and thought to
have a nap; but Mohammed Jafar, who after all joined us some time
before, would not hear of this.&nbsp; It would be dangerous; the
Shirazi would swoop down from those hills to the north.&nbsp; He
altogether declined remaining longer than necessary, and there
was an earnestness in his manner that brought conviction with it;
he really believed in the danger he talked of.&nbsp; The night
was fine, and it would have been a pity not to make use of it; we
pushed on over good <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>ground for an hour, and after that
through mud, ditches, and frogs; about one o&rsquo;clock a wide
ditch completely barred further progress.&nbsp; We had for a good
while been again among crops, so rank that wading through them
was hard work, and on reaching this ditch, we all groped about,
trying to find a passage for the camels.&nbsp; There was no sort
of track; the horsemen had, in fact, got off the road and could
not find it again, but there was no difficulty as to general
direction, the Scorpion being our guide.&nbsp; Here, however, we
were stuck fast by irrigation works, for at this particular spot
the ditch was impracticable for camels, and all efforts in the
dark to hit upon a ford were vain.&nbsp; The horsemen had already
got across, and were shouting to us to follow; indeed, they had
for the last hour guided us in a haphazard way by shouts and
singing.&nbsp; One of them sang remarkably well, and kept up a
sort of refrain:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p216.jpg">
<img alt=
"A line of musical notes"
title=
"A line of musical notes"
src="images/p216.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But now they screamed, shouted, and sang to no purpose.&nbsp;
We refused to waste any more time in a useless search, and sat
down to wait for daylight.&nbsp; One of the khayal then returned
and sat with us till four <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>
talking all the while to Hajji Mohammed about the Shirazi.&nbsp;
We lay down and went to sleep.&nbsp; By half-past four we had
found a <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>passage through the mud and water of the canal, and
beyond it got on to desert ground, on which we passed several
small detached oasis-like palm gardens.&nbsp; Half an
hour&rsquo;s march further took us to Jaz&ucirc;n.</p>
<p>Jaz&ucirc;n is the only village left of many which once
existed between Sultanabad and Bebahan, and whose ruins we have
passed.&nbsp; They were deserted only a few years ago; the
governors of the province, who found it impossible to collect
taxes from them, having solved the difficulty by destroying
them.&nbsp; This village is now a collection of little mud houses
on the left bank of a natural stream of running water.&nbsp; It
is surrounded by fields and groups of palm trees.&nbsp; Our
horses are tethered out by long ropes fastened to palm trees, to
feed on green barley; the camels are further off with
Shafi.&nbsp; Shafi is an excellent worker, but he does not speak
a word of Arabic, or I should tell him how well satisfied we are
with him.&nbsp; We ourselves have encamped on the high bank
backed by the stream, so that the villagers, who are a tiresome
set of people, can only approach us on one side.</p>
<p>Jaz&ucirc;n as well as Sultanabad, belongs to the family of
Mohammed Jafar.&nbsp; He has been sitting here talking to us
through Hajji Mohammed.&nbsp; He tells us that his family,
although they now no longer talk Arabic, are of the Safeyeh
tribe, and came originally from Nejd, bringing their horses with
them; and that a beautiful little white mare his <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>nephew
rides, and which we admired yesterday evening, is a Hamdanyeh
Simri.&nbsp; This mare is very small, 13&middot;2 at most, but
almost perfect; the head very fine with black nose, black round
the eyes as if painted, <i>jebha</i> prominent, and
<i>mitbakh</i> extremely fine; tail properly set on and carried,
a good style of going, bones rather small, but legs apparently
wiry and strong.&nbsp; One of the men rides a chestnut mare said
to be Keh&icirc;leh Sheykhah, about 14 hands, with four white
feet, handsome head, and <i>mitbakh</i>.&nbsp; Mohammed Jafar
mentioned that the particular breeds now possessed by his tribe
are Hamdani Simri, Abeyan, Hadban, Wadnan, Meleyhan, Seglawi and
Keh&icirc;lan.&nbsp; His own grey mare does not look
thoroughbred, and he did not say anything about her.&nbsp;
Mohammed Jafar now informed us that his nephew would proceed to
Bebahan with us while he himself must go home, and he wished to
have the whole sum of one hundred krans paid to him at
once.&nbsp; After some talk he agreed to take seventy krans as
his share, the rest to be given to his nephew at the end of the
journey.&nbsp; He certainly gets the lion&rsquo;s share, but
beggars cannot be choosers, and we are dependent on his goodwill
to pass us through this part of the country, so that on the whole
we ought to be glad that he has not asked more.&nbsp; We are
altogether in a false position, too weak to insist upon our own
terms, and our best plan is to march as fast as we can to
Bebahan.&nbsp; Unfortunately there are not only <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>crags to
cross, but the Kurdistan river has to be forded.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 19.&mdash;A disagreeable twenty-four hours has
passed, and we have scaled the crags, and escaped from the
Jaz&ucirc;n people, who, it seems, had some evil design.&nbsp;
But there is still the Kurdistan river between us and
Bebahan.</p>
<p>We managed to set out from Jaz&ucirc;n soon after two
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, getting at once off the plain on
to broken ground, which became more and more broken till at seven
o&rsquo;clock, when we halted, we were involved in a confused
mass of hills apparently tossed together at random.&nbsp; We had
crossed several small streams in deep ravines, and one narrow
ledge of rock at the head of a ravine, which would have been
unpleasant in the dark.&nbsp; Saw three or four gazelles, luckily
not perceived by the greyhounds, for we cannot stop for
sport.&nbsp; Sand-grouse, beebirds, plovers, and doves
abounded.&nbsp; By seven o&rsquo;clock we had done about ten
miles and ascended over 600 feet, and Wilfrid proposed to halt
for some hours.&nbsp; I was pleased, not liking passes and steeps
in the dark, and we still had the pass itself before us, but
Abdallah Khan, the Ka&iuml;d&rsquo;s nephew, remonstrated and
protested danger.&nbsp; Wilfrid, however, gave a peremptory order
to unload the camels and we sat down to drink tea and make a
frugal meal, and proposed afterwards to make aliek for the
camels, as they have had a tiring march and cannot feed now in
the night.&nbsp; <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Before we had done eating Hajji Mohammed came to
announce that forty Jaz&ucirc;nis were following to attack and
plunder us.&nbsp; Shafi, he said, had found this out, and told
him, and he added that the welled Abdallah Khan had also been
told of the plot and warned by the villagers not to stay with
us.&nbsp; He called the youth, who confirmed the tale, as did all
the others, the four men on foot who had come all the way with
Abdallah.&nbsp; It seems probable that an attack really was
contemplated, for Shafi could gain nothing by inventing such a
story.&nbsp; But, as Wilfrid suggested, it may have been only a
way of &ldquo;expressing the polite feelings of the inhabitants
of Jaz&ucirc;n.&rdquo;&nbsp; He however agreed that we ought to
be on the watch and start as soon as possible&mdash;at this
moment it was really impossible.&nbsp; Guns and revolvers were
placed ready and sentinels posted, and Abdallah earnestly assured
us he would stand by us.&nbsp; I think he would, he had been a
much better guide than his uncle and was besides always ready to
help and to wait for the camels at difficult places.&nbsp; After
all this agitation, nothing happened except one or two false
alarms, and I don&rsquo;t think I ever slept a sweeter sleep than
between nine and two o&rsquo;clock this night&mdash;no mosquitoes
and no flies.</p>
<p>It took us more than an hour to load in the dark, and we were
not off till past three o&rsquo;clock; at first feeling our way
in single file, led by Abdallah, along a very broken and steep
road.&nbsp; For part of the way <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>we had a little assistance from a
red crescent moon.&nbsp; At a quarter to six, we had gained the
highest point of the ridge, between 1600 and 1700 feet above the
sea, making about 900 feet ascent from Jaz&ucirc;n.&nbsp; Here
there was at last an open view, down towards the Kurdistan river,
with the palm village of Ka&iuml;kus plainly visible, and other
palm villages beyond the river, and still further something
vague, said to be Bebahan.</p>
<p>A gradual descent brought us on to a strip of plain, swarming
with cuckoos, beebirds, doves, francolins, and sandgrouse, and
dotted with canora trees, singly or in clumps, here and there
fields of corn.</p>
<p>The sight of a mound commanding air, if air there should be,
decided us to halt, and here we now are, waiting for the decline
of day to set out again and ford the river.&nbsp; This plain by
the river is hardly more than three hundred feet below the top of
the pass we came over this morning.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>April</i> 20.&mdash;Bebahan has been reached
at last.&nbsp; Our final march, though not a long one, took us
till towards midnight to accomplish, for we had the Kurdistan
river to cross.&nbsp; This was the deepest of any we had forded,
and there was a long delay in choosing a safe place; and then the
water was up to our saddle bows, and running almost like a mill
race.&nbsp; But the camels are now so used to water in every form
from mud to torrents, that all marched bravely through, a portion
only of the <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>luggage getting wet.&nbsp; Unfitted though the country
has been in many ways for camels, we may nevertheless
congratulate ourselves with the thought that with no other beasts
of burden could we have got our luggage across the rivers at
all.&nbsp; Loaded mules must have been swept away.</p>
<p>The Kurdistan forms the boundary on this side of the
cultivated plain of Bebahan.&nbsp; Beyond it, we found ourselves
travelling entirely between cornfields, and along a broad highway
towards the capital of Khusistan.&nbsp; When two hours from the
town we sent on Hajji Mohammed to announce us to the governor,
but the governor was already asleep, and it was with some
difficulty that we were admitted by the guard within the gate;
nor was it possible in the utter darkness of the night to choose
our ground within for camping.&nbsp; In the first open place we
stopped, and as we were, lay down and slept (we care little now,
how or where it is we lie, the ground is always soft as a
feather-bed).&nbsp; Then, with the first light, we went on
through the town and stopped again in front of the
Sera&iuml;.&nbsp; Here I have been writing my journal and
sketching the picturesque old palace, with its tottering minarets
covered with storks&rsquo; nests.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Shahzade is
still sleeping,&rdquo; say the sentries, &ldquo;and will not be
awakened.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">A last rush through the sun&mdash;We arrive at
Dilam on the Persian Gulf&mdash;Politics of the Gulf&mdash;A
journey &ldquo;in extremis&rdquo;&mdash;Bushire&mdash;The
End.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rest of our journey was little
better than a feverish dream of heat and flies.&nbsp; After a day
spent at Bebahan, where we were hospitably entertained by the
Shahzade, Ahtesham ed-Daulah, a Persian nobleman of real good
breeding, we recommenced our weary march, thinking only now to
get down to Bushire alive.</p>
<p>The kind invitations of our host could not detain us, nor the
polite attentions of his wives, nor the amiable visits of
merchants, calendars, and other idle persons, who thronged our
lodgings from dawn to dusk.&nbsp; The truth is Bebahan was like a
furnace, and we felt that it was more than our strength would
stand, to prolong our sufferings over another week.&nbsp; The
lowlands of Persia, bordering on the Persian Gulf, are one of the
most oven-like regions of the world, and though Bebahan lies
nearly 1400 feet above the sea, it shares the climate of the
Gulf.&nbsp; <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>We had now, besides, nothing further to fear in the way
of robbers or marauders, and prepared ourselves for a last
desperate rush through the sun to Bushire.&nbsp; The distance was
hardly more than a hundred and twenty miles, but between Bebahan
and Dilam there lay a region of hills, worse, according to
report, than any we had yet passed, and absolutely impassable for
camels.&nbsp; Still we had good reason to feel confident in the
climbing powers of our beasts, and could not think of leaving
them behind.&nbsp; Accordingly the next day we started, our
courage well screwed to the sticking point of endurance, and
under escort of three of the Shahzade&rsquo;s horsemen.</p>
<p>We set off at six in the afternoon, making the best of what
daylight yet remained to get well started on our road.&nbsp; The
difficulties are almost always greater close to the town, and
once fairly on the beaten track, our camels would have no
temptation to wander.&nbsp; From Bebahan to Dilam there are two
considerable lines of ridges or hills&mdash;steps, as it were,
and extremely precipitous ones, down to the sea coast.&nbsp; At
first it was easy going for the camels, but presently, about an
hour after dark, we found ourselves in broken ground, where,
after stumbling on till half-past nine, we were brought to a dead
halt by finding ourselves at the brink of a deep gulf, in which
the road seemed to disappear.&nbsp; This made it necessary we
should wait till daylight, and we lay down with our camels on the
road, and <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>slept soundly till the first streak of dawn at
half-past four.&nbsp; Then we discovered we had left the road,
though only a few yards, and that the fissure before us was a
sufficient reason for the halt we had made.&nbsp; The chief
formation of these hills is not rock but clay, which being
entirely without vegetation except in favoured spots, is furrowed
into ravines and fissures by the action of the rain, making the
district impassable except along the beaten track.&nbsp; We had
risen some hundred feet from Bebahan, and so had nearly reached
the summit of the first pass, where to our joy we saw something
far away which we knew by instinct must be the sea.&nbsp; This
raised our spirits, and we began our descent at once.</p>
<p>The path was very precipitous, and looking down from the edge
it looked impossible that a camel should get down the thousand
feet of zigzag which one could see plainly to the bottom.&nbsp;
In some places rocks jutted out of the soil, making awkward
narrow passes, and in others there were drops of three feet and
more.&nbsp; Our horses of course made no difficulty, but watching
the camels was nervous work, knowing as we did how little could
be done to help them.&nbsp; Still we did what we could, going in
front and calling them &ldquo;Hao-hao,&rdquo; according to
Bedouin fashion, which they understand so well.&nbsp; They know
us now and trust in us, and so came bravely on.&nbsp; Even the
Mecca del&uacute;l and the Safra, the young and giddy ones, have
learned sobriety.&nbsp; <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>Three hours exactly it took to get
down, and without accident.&nbsp; Another hour brought us to
Zeytun, a pretty village on the river Zorah, with palm gardens
and a good patch of cultivated land.&nbsp; At the river we
stopped, exhausted already by the sun and overcome by the sight
of the cool running water.&nbsp; Here we lay frizzling till the
afternoon.</p>
<p>At four we crossed the river, as broad but a little less deep
than the Kurdistan (both have gravelly bottoms), and resumed our
march.&nbsp; A last cup of the ice-cold water was indulged in,
but it could not slake my thirst, which nothing now can cure,
though as a rule we drink nothing till the evening.&nbsp; Our
march was a repetition of last night&rsquo;s, a long stumble half
asleep along a break-neck road ending as before in an
&ldquo;impasse,&rdquo; and the rest of the night spent on the
ground.&nbsp; We are plagued now, especially in these night
halts, where we cannot see to choose a bed, with the horrible
little spiked grass.&nbsp; Every bit of clothing we have is full
of these points.&nbsp; These and the flies make it impossible to
sleep by day, and we are both very weary, Wilfrid almost a
skeleton.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 23.&mdash;At a quarter past three, we again went
on, by the light of a false dawn, the Scorpion, still in front of
us.&nbsp; We know exactly now the rising of these stars in the
south-eastern sky.&nbsp; The ascent this time was longer and more
gradual, and the descent shorter than the former one, but quite
as difficult.&nbsp; This second ridge is considerably lower <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>than the
first, and at the foot of it our path followed a sort of valley
in which we found a few pools of water.&nbsp; Then suddenly the
gorge opened and we found ourselves at eight o&rsquo;clock in the
plain, with a village near us, and about eight miles away Dilam
and the sea, simmering like melted lead to the horizon.</p>
<p>Eight miles, it sounds an easy march; but the heat, which now
on the sea coast is more insufferable than ever, stopped us half
way, and again we rigged up our tent on the plain, and lay under
it till evening.&nbsp; Then we rode into Dilam.&nbsp; Our first
question was for Captain Cameron, whose road should here have
joined our own; but no Frank or stranger of any kind had passed
that way. <a name="citation227"></a><a href="#footnote227"
class="citation">[227]</a></p>
<p>Dilam, like most maritime villages on the north-eastern shore
of the Persian Gulf, is inhabited by people of Arab race, who
have carried on a mixed trade of commerce and piracy there from
time immemorial.&nbsp; Of the two, the piracy seems to have been
the more profitable trade, for since its suppression by the
English or rather Indian navy, the villages have
languished.&nbsp; The Arab idea of piracy by sea, is exactly the
same as that of ghaz&uacute;s by land.&nbsp; Any stranger not in
alliance with the tribe, or under its protection, is held to be
an enemy, and <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>his goods to be lawful prize.&nbsp; The greater part,
however, of the armed expeditions, formerly made in the Gulf were
directed by one tribe or village against another tribe or
village, and were called in Arabic ghaz&uacute;s no less than if
they had been made by land.&nbsp; The British Government,
however, naturally found these ideas antiquated and the practice
inconvenient, and in the interests of its commerce undertook,
thirty or forty years ago, to keep the police of the Gulf.&nbsp;
It compelled the Sheykhs of the various towns and villages to
enter into what is called the Truce of the Gulf, and piracy has
disappeared.&nbsp; Expeditions henceforth, if made at all, were
to be made by land, and armed vessels, if met by an English
cruiser, were confiscated.&nbsp; This sealed the fate of the
coast villages, for the commerce of the Gulf alone being
insufficient to support them, their inhabitants took up new
quarters further inland, and from sailors became cultivators of
the soil.&nbsp; The sea-port villages, where ports there are,
still live on but poorly, and where there are no ports, the coast
is abandoned.&nbsp; Dilam possesses no regular port, except for
small boats, but the anchorage is good, and I believe the
roadstead is considered one of the best in the Gulf.&nbsp; It has
been talked of as the terminus of an Indo-Mediterranean
railway.</p>
<p>Dilam now is a poor place of perhaps two hundred houses, but
there are a few well-to-do people in it who presently came out to
pay us their respects.&nbsp; The English name is well known on
the coast, and there <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>was no danger now of any lack of
courtesy.&nbsp; We were besieged at once with hospitable offers
of entertainment for man and beast, but as usual preferred our
camp outside the town.&nbsp; This we placed on a strip of sand
dunes fronting the sea, and dividing it from the level plain
which runs inland ten miles to the foot of the hills.&nbsp; This
strip was scattered over with thorn bushes, in one of which a
pair of cormorants were sitting.&nbsp; Our visitors remonstrated
with us on choosing such a spot, assuring us that it was full of
poisonous snakes, but this no doubt was nonsense.&nbsp; Among the
rest came a wild-looking man with a gun, who told us he was a
Beluch, and sent by the governor of Dilam as a guard, to protect
us during the night.&nbsp; He had been in Turkish service, and
was now in the Persian.&nbsp; This was our first meeting with
anything Indian.&nbsp; We liked the man.&nbsp; In the evening,
when it was dark and all were gone, Wilfrid gave himself the
luxury of bathing in salt water.</p>
<p>We had now done what few if any Europeans had done
before,&mdash;come all the way by land from the Mediterranean to
the Persian Gulf: our journey had been over two thousand
miles.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 24.&mdash;There was now a great debate whether we
should go on still by land for the other hundred miles which
remained to us before we could reach Bushire, or whether, selling
our camels here at Dilam, we should hire a sefineh, or native
boat, to convey us with our things by sea.&nbsp; Wilfrid <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>was much
taken with this last idea, thinking that the arrangement would
save us from another week&rsquo;s toil in the overwhelming heat;
but to me the sight of the rickety boats in which we should have
had to trust ourselves and our horses to the mercy of the winds
and waves, was sufficient to make me rejoice that the negotiation
about a sea journey failed.&nbsp; Then it was decided to march on
as before.&nbsp; There seemed something sad, too, in abandoning
our camels here, and taking to the ships of the sea where they
could not follow us; and though we knew our parting from them was
anyhow at hand, it was a respite to take them on.&nbsp; We had
got, from our long care of them, to take great pride in their
condition, and they were now fat and free from mange, a triumph
of management which only those who have travelled far and loved
their camels will understand.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 24th, having spent just twenty-four
hours at Dilam, we struck our tents, and began our last
march.</p>
<p>The country bordering the Persian Gulf is here a dead flat,
little, if anything, raised above the level of the sea.&nbsp; It
is very barren, and impregnated for the most part with saltpetre,
while here and there broad tidal creeks intersect it, wherever a
stream runs into it from the hills.&nbsp; These formed the only
obstacle to our march, and we travelled more easily now by night,
for there began to be a moon.</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>I
hurry over these last days, indeed the heat and the march
absorbed all our faculties and thought.&nbsp; Our plan was to
start about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when usually a
light breeze sprang up from the south-east, and travel on till
the moon set, or till some creek barred passage for the night;
then sleep upon the ground till dawn, and on again till
eight.&nbsp; By that hour the sun had become a fierce and
importunate thing, beating as if with a weight upon our heads;
and, choosing a place where there was some show of pasture, we
unloaded and turned out our beasts to graze, and then rigged up
the tent and lay gasping under it in the breathless air,
supporting life with tea.&nbsp; Hajji Mohammed now was only
capable of tea-making.&nbsp; In all things else he had become
idiotic, sitting half back on his beast, or in the tent,
ejaculating: &ldquo;Allah kerim,&rdquo; God is generous.&nbsp;
Our tempers all were severely tried, and we could do little now
to help each other.&nbsp; Ghada and Rahim, Arab and Persian, were
at daggers drawn.&nbsp; The horses&rsquo; backs for the first
time were getting sore, and the dogs were run nearly off the
soles of their feet.&nbsp; Shiekha and Sayad in a course in which
they killed a gazelle were injured, the former having cut her
feet badly on the glazed edges of some dry cracked mud she had
galloped over.&nbsp; Lastly, and this was a terrible grief, one
of the camels being badly loaded had slipped its pack, and in the
fall Rasham had been crushed.&nbsp; The falcon&rsquo;s leg was
broken, and for the last three days <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>of our journey, it seemed impossible
he should live, clinging as he was obliged to do by one leg to
the saddle.&nbsp; It was all like a night-mare, with no redeeming
feature but that we knew now the end was close at hand.</p>
<p>On the 25th we reached Gunawa, on the 26th Bender Rik and on
the 27th, Rohalla, where we crossed the river, and then marching
on without halting through the night, we forded a shallow arm of
the sea, and found ourselves the next morning about dawn upon the
edge of the Khor, or salt lake of Bushire.&nbsp; As the sun rose
Bushire itself was before us, and our long march was at an
end.</p>
<p>It was now necessary to abandon our nomadic life, and shipping
all our goods in a &ldquo;baggara,&rdquo; and leaving the
unloaded camels to be driven round at low tide to the neck of the
Bushire peninsula, we put ourselves and our dogs and bird on
board, and with a fresh breeze ran in two hours to the
custom-house landing.&nbsp; There, taken for Arabs, we had long
to wait, but in the end procuring porters, walked in procession
through the streets to the Residency.&nbsp; When we arrived at
the door of the Residency, the well-dressed Sepoys in their smart
European uniforms, barred us the door with their muskets.&nbsp;
They refused to believe that such vagabonds, blackened with the
sun, and grimed with long sleeping on the ground, were English
gentlefolks or honest people of any sort.</p>

235</span>NOTES ON THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF NORTHERN
ARABIA.</h3>
<p>Arabia between latitude 34&deg; and latitude 29&deg;, may be
described in general terms as a plain of sand-stone grit, or
gravel, unbroken by any considerable range of hills, or by any
continuous watercourse, if we except the Wady Hauran, which
traverses it in the extreme north and in rainy seasons forms a
succession of pools from the Harra, east of Jebel Hauran, to the
Euphrates.&nbsp; This stony plain is known to the Bedouins as the
Ham&aacute;d or &ldquo;Plain&rdquo; <i>par excellence</i>; and
though for the most part destitute of perennial pasture, or of
water above ground, there are certain districts in it better
provided which form their winter quarters.&nbsp; Such are the
above mentioned Wady Hauran, the resort of the Bisshr
&Aacute;nazeh, and the Wady-er-Rothy, of the Daffir, and
Shammar.&nbsp; A few wells would seem to exist on the line of
certain ancient routes, traversing the Ham&aacute;d from various
points on the Euphrates, and these form centres of attraction to
the tribes.&nbsp; But their immediate neighbourhood is invariably
barren, having been pitilessly browsed down for centuries.&nbsp;
Routes of this sort connect K&acirc;f with Shedadi, Meskakeh with
Suk-esh-Shi&oacute;kh, and J&ocirc;f with Maan.&nbsp; But the <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>best
frequented of them and that best supplied with water is the great
Haj road from Meshhed Ali to Jebel Shammar, called the road of
Zobeydeh.&nbsp; On this wells and reservoirs were constructed in
the 9th century, by the widow of Harun-el-Rashid, and
kh&aacute;ns, for the convenience of pilgrims, the ruins of which
still exist.</p>
<p>The <i>Ham&aacute;d</i>, starting from the level of the
Euphrates, rises rapidly for a few miles through a district much
intersected by ravines, to an upper plateau, which thenceforward
has a fairly regular slope upwards towards the west and south of
8 to 10 feet per mile.&nbsp; The drainage of the plain would not,
however, seem to be continuous towards the river; but to
terminate in certain sandy hollows, known by the name <i>Buttn
J&ocirc;f</i> or <i>Bekka</i>, all signifying belly or
receptacle, which may in former times have been lakes or small
inland seas.&nbsp; These do not now at any time of the year hold
water above ground, but at the depth of a few feet below the
surface it may be found in wells.&nbsp; Such are the Buttn on the
Haj road, in which the Wady-er-Rothy terminates, the oases of
Taibetism and Jobba in the south, and I believe that of Teyma in
the west; but the most remarkable of them all is without
comparison the so-called Wady and J&ocirc;f of Sirhan.</p>
<p>The <i>Wady Sirhan</i> bisects northern Arabia in a line
parallel with the Euphrates and with the coast lines of the
Peninsula, that is to say, nearly from N.W. to S.E.&nbsp;
Immediately east and north of it the Ham&aacute;d reaches its
highest level, 2,500 feet above the sea; and the cliffs bounding
it on this side are rather abrupt, corresponding, as I am
inclined to think, with the general formation of the plain.&nbsp;
This consists of a series of shelves set one above the other,
with their edges opposed to the general slope; a formation very
evident on the Haj road, where the traveller from Nejd, though in
reality descending at a general rate of more than eight feet to
the mile, is tempted <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>to fancy himself on an ascending
road, owing to the frequent <i>Akabas</i> or steep cliffs he has
to climb.&nbsp; I am inclined, therefore, to believe that the
Wady Sirhan and the J&ocirc;f receive their drainage principally
from the west, and that there is a second great watershed to the
plain in the volcanic region, which, according to Guarmani,
continues the Hauran ridge southwards to Tabuk.&nbsp; East of the
Wady Sirhan I was struck by the absence of large tributary wadys
such as one would expect if the area drained was a wide
one.&nbsp; The Wady Sirhan, however, in the days when it was an
inland sea, must have received contributions from all
sides.&nbsp; It lies as a trough between two watersheds in the
plain, and may have been supplied from Jebel Aja in the south, as
it is still supplied from Jebel Hauran in the north.&nbsp; Its
general level below that of the adjacent plain eastwards, is
about 500 feet, and the plain may rise again still higher to the
west.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, one thing is clear, namely, that the Wady
was and is the great central receptacle of the plain, and
corresponds pretty closely with its neighbour, the still existing
Dead Sea, while the Wady-er-Rajel entering it from the north,
holds towards it the position of the Jordan.&nbsp; Water in the
Wady Sirhan is found at a nearly uniform level of 1850 feet; and
this rule applies to that part of it which is known as the
J&ocirc;f as well as to the rest.&nbsp; The abundance of water
obtainable from its wells along a line extending 300 miles from
the frontier of Syria, to within 200 of the frontier of Nejd,
points out Wady Sirhan as the natural high road of Northern
Arabia, and such it must from the earliest times have been.&nbsp;
It is probable that in the days when Arabia was more populous
than now, villages existed in it at intervals from Ezrak to
J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; At present, the wells of these only remain, if
we except the twin oases of K&acirc;f and Ithery, still preserved
in life by the salt lakes which supply them with an article <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>of
trade.&nbsp; These are but poor places, and their population can
hardly exceed two hundred souls.</p>
<p>J&ocirc;f and Meskakeh are still flourishing towns, but I have
reason to think their population has been over estimated by Mr.
Palgrave.&nbsp; I cannot put the total number of houses in
J&ocirc;f at more than 500, nor in Meskakeh at more than 600,
while 100 houses are an ample allowance for Kara and the other
hamlets of the J&ocirc;f oasis.&nbsp; This would give us a census
of hardly 8,000 souls, whereas Mr. Palgrave puts it at
40,000.&nbsp; I do not, however, pretend to accuracy on this
point.</p>
<p>With regard to the geology of the Ham&aacute;d and the
adjacent districts north of the Nef&ucirc;d, I believe that
sandstone is throughout the principal element.&nbsp; In the
extreme north, indeed, limestone takes its place or conglomerate;
but, with the exception of a single district about 100 miles
south of Meshhed Ali on the Haj road, I do not think our route
crossed any true calcareous rock.&nbsp; The cliffs which form the
eastern boundary of the Wady Sirhan are, I think, all of
sandstone, south at any rate of Jebel Mizmeh, as are certainly
the hills of J&ocirc;f and Meskakeh, the rocks of Aalem and
Jobba, and all the outlying peaks and ridges north-west of
Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; These have been described as basaltic or of dark
granite, the mistake arising from their colour which, though very
varied, is in many instances black.&nbsp; The particular form of
sandstone in which iron occurs, seems indeed to acquire a dark
weathering with exposure, and unless closely examined, has a
volcanic look.&nbsp; I do not, however, believe that south of
latitude 31&deg; the volcanic stones of the Haura are really met
with; unless indeed it be west of the Wady Sirhan.&nbsp; Jebel
Mizmeh, the highest point east of it, is alone perhaps
basaltic.&nbsp; The whole of the J&ocirc;f district reminded me
geologically of the sandstone formation of Sina&iuml;, both in
the excentric outline of its rocks, which are often mushroom
shaped, and in <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>their colour, where purple, violet, dark red, orange,
white and even blue and green are found, the harder rock assuming
generally an upper weathering of black.&nbsp; I can state
positively that nothing basaltic occurs on the road between
J&ocirc;f and Jebel Aja.&nbsp; Of Jebel Mizmeh I am less certain,
as I did not actually touch the stone, but, if volcanic it be, it
is the extreme limit of the Harra southwards.&nbsp; The tells of
K&acirc;f I certainly took to be of basalt when I passed
them.&nbsp; But I did not then consider how easily I might be
mistaken.&nbsp; On the whole I am inclined to place latitude
31&deg; as the boundary of the volcanic district east of the
Wady.</p>
<p>The bed of the Wady Sirhan is principally of sand, though in
some places there is a clayey deposit sufficient to form
subbkhas, or salt lakes, notably at K&acirc;f and Ithery.&nbsp;
About three days&rsquo; journey E.S.E. of Ithery, I heard of
quicksands, but did not myself cross any ground holding
water.&nbsp; The sand of the Wady Sirhan, like that of all the
hollows both of the Ham&aacute;d and of northern Nejd, is nearly
white, and has little to distinguish it from the ordinary sand of
the sea shore, or of the Isthmus of Suez.&nbsp; It is far less
fertile than the red sand of the Nef&ucirc;d, and is more easily
affected by the wind.&nbsp; The ghada is found growing wherever
the sand is pure, and I noticed it as far north as
K&acirc;f.&nbsp; In some parts of the Wady which appear to hold
water in rainy seasons, there is much saltpetre on the surface,
and there the vegetation is rank, but of little value as
pasture.&nbsp; In the pure white sand, little else but the ghada
grows.&nbsp; Wady Sirhan is the summer quarters of the
Sherarat.</p>
<p>The <i>Harra</i> is a high region of black volcanic boulders
too well known to need description.&nbsp; It begins as far north
as the latitude of Damascus, and stretches from the foot of the
Hauran hills eastward for some fifty miles, when it gives place
to the Ham&aacute;d.&nbsp; Southwards it extends to K&acirc;f, <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>and forms
the water shed of the plain east of the Wady Sirhan.&nbsp;
According to Guarmani, it is found again west of the Wady, as far
south as Tebuk.&nbsp; The eastern watershed of the Harra would
seem with the Jebel Hauran to feed the Wady-er-Rajel, a bed
sometimes containing running water, and on its opposite slope the
Wady Hauran which reaches the Euphrates.&nbsp; The Harra is more
plentifully supplied with water than the Ham&aacute;d, and has a
reputation of fertility wherever the soil is uncovered by the
boulders.</p>
<p><i>The Nef&ucirc;d</i>.&mdash;A little north of latitude
29&prime;, the Ham&aacute;d, which has to this point been a bare
plain of gravel broken only by occasional hollows, the beds of
ancient seas, suddenly becomes heaped over with high ridges of
pure red sand.&nbsp; The transition from the smooth hard plain to
the broken dunes of the Nef&ucirc;d is very startling.&nbsp; The
sand rises abruptly from the plain without any transition
whatever; and it is easy to see that the plain is not really
changed but only hidden from the eye by a super-incumbent
mass.&nbsp; Its edge is so well defined that it is hardly an
exaggeration to say that with one foot a man may stand upon the
Ham&aacute;d, and with the other on the Nef&ucirc;d; nor is there
much irregularity in its outline.&nbsp; The limit of the sand for
several hundred miles runs almost evenly from east to west, and
it is only at these extremities that it becomes broken and
irregular.&nbsp; Such, at least, I believe to be the case; and
if, as seems probable, the whole drift of sand has been shaped by
prevailing easterly winds, the phenomenon is less strange than
might be thought.</p>
<p>The great Nef&ucirc;d of Northern Arabia extends from the
wells of Lina in the east to Teyma in the west, and from the edge
of the J&ocirc;f basin in the north to the foot of Jebel Aja in
the south.&nbsp; In its greatest breadth it is 150 miles, and in
its greatest length 400 miles, but the whole of this <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>is not
continuous sand.&nbsp; The extreme eastern portion (and perhaps
also the extreme western) is but a series of long strips, from
half a mile to five miles in breadth, running parallel to each
other, and separated by intervening strips of solid plain.&nbsp;
Nor is the sand everywhere of equal depth; the intermittent
Nef&ucirc;ds are comparatively shallow, and would seem to bear a
certain proportion in depth to the breadth of the strips.&nbsp;
Thus the highest sand ridge crossed by the Haj road is barely
eighty feet, while others are but fifty and twenty feet.&nbsp;
The continuous Nef&ucirc;d on the other hand, between J&ocirc;f
and Ha&iuml;l, has a depth of at least two hundred feet.&nbsp;
The intermittent ridges may possibly suggest an explanation of
the original formation of the mass.&nbsp; It would seem as if the
wind acting upon the sand drove it at first into lines, and that,
as these grew broader and deeper, they at last filled up the
intervening space, and formed themselves into a continuous mass
at their lee end.&nbsp; If this be the case, the intermittent
ridges show the direction in which the solid mass of sand is
advancing, the direction, that is, contrary to that of the
wind.&nbsp; I leave this deduction, however, to more competent
persons than myself to draw, contenting myself with recording the
fact.</p>
<p>The red sand of the Nef&ucirc;d is of a different texture from
the ordinary white sand of the desert, and seems to obey
mechanical laws of its own.&nbsp; It is coarser in texture and
far less volatile, and I am inclined to think that the ordinary
light winds which vary sandy surfaces elsewhere leave it very
little affected.&nbsp; A strong wind alone, amounting to a gale,
could raise it high in the air.&nbsp; It is remarkable that
whereas the light white sand is generally found in low hollows,
or on the lee side of hills, the red sand of the Nef&ucirc;d has
been heaped up into a lofty mass high above the highest part of
the plain.&nbsp; The Ham&aacute;d where the Nef&ucirc;d begins is
2,200 feet above the sea.&nbsp; No traveller <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>can see
this desert of red sand for the first time without acknowledging
its individuality.&nbsp; It is as little like the ordinary sand
dunes of the desert, as a glacier is like an ordinary snow field
in the Alps.&nbsp; It seems, like the glacier, to have a law of
being peculiar to itself, a law of increase, of motion, almost of
life.&nbsp; One is struck with these in traversing it, and one
seems to recognise an organism.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The most remarkable phenomenon of the Nef&ucirc;d are the long
lines of horse-hoof shaped hollows, called <i>fuljes</i>, with
which its surface is pitted; these are only observable where the
sand has attained a depth of from 80 to 100 feet, and are
consequently seldom found in the intermittent portion of the
Nef&ucirc;d; while it is remarkable that in the very centre of
all, where it might be supposed the sand was deepest, the fuljes
are less deep than towards the northern and southern edges, while
the lines in which they run become more regular.&nbsp; Indeed,
for some miles on either side of Aalem, which marks the centre of
the Nef&ucirc;d, there are no large fuljes; but their strings are
so regular as to form, with the intervening spaces, a kind of
shallow ridge and furrow running nearly east and west, and not
altogether unlike, on a gigantic scale, those ridges in which
meadows are sometimes laid down in England.&nbsp; From the top of
Aalem this formation was very distinct.</p>
<p>The fuljes themselves are singularly uniform in shape, though
varying in size.&nbsp; They represent very closely horse tracks
on an enormous scale, that is to say a half-circle, deep at the
curved end or toe, and shelving up to the level of the plain at
the square end or heel.&nbsp; The sides of the <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>former are
as precipitous as it is in the nature of sand to be, and they
terminate abruptly where they meet the floor of the fulj.&nbsp;
This floor, sloping downwards towards the toe at an angle of
about 70&deg;, and scored with water-courses converging to a
centre, roughly represents the frog, so that in plan the whole
hollow would appear as in the woodcut A; while in section it
would appear as in woodcut B.&nbsp; It is necessary, therefore,
in entering a fulj on horseback, or with camels, to approach it
from the east; but on foot one can slip down the sand at any
point.&nbsp; I noticed that just west of the deep fuljes there is
generally a high mound of sand, which adds considerably to their
apparent depth and to the delusion of their being artificial in
their origin, as though the sand scooped out has been thrown up
by a digger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The size and depth of the fuljes varies greatly; some are, as
it were, rudimentary only, while others attain a depth of 200
feet and more.&nbsp; The deepest of those I measured proved to be
280 feet, including the sand hill, which may have been 60 feet
above the general level of the plain; its width seemed about a
quarter of a mile.&nbsp; At the bottom of these deep fuljes,
solid ground is reached, and there is generally a stony deposit
there, such as I have often noticed in sandy places where water
has stood.&nbsp; This bare space is seldom more than a few paces
in diameter.&nbsp; I heard of, but did not see, one which
contained a well.&nbsp; The wells of Shagik do not stand in a
fulj, but in a valley clear of sand, and those of Jobba in a
broad <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>circular basin 400 feet below the level of the
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; The fuljes, I have said, run in strings
irregularly from east to west, corresponding in this with their
individual direction. <a name="citation244"></a><a
href="#footnote244" class="citation">[244]</a>&nbsp; They are
most regularly placed in the neighbourhood of the rocks of Aalem,
but their size there is less than either north or south of
it.&nbsp; The shape of the fuljes seems unaffected by the solid
ground beneath, for at the rocks of Ghota there is a large fulj
pierced by the rocks, but which otherwise retains its
semi-circular form.</p>
<p>The physical features of the Nef&ucirc;d, whether they be
ridges or mounds or fuljes, appear to be permanent in their
character.&nbsp; The red sand of which they are composed is less
volatile than the common sand of the desert and, except on the
summits of the mounds and ridges, seems little affected by the
wind.&nbsp; It is everywhere, except in such positions, sprinkled
over with brushwood ghada trees and tufts of grass.&nbsp; The
sides of the fuljes especially are well clothed, and this could
hardly be the case if they were liable to change with a change of
wind.&nbsp; In the Nef&ucirc;d between Jobba and Igneh I noticed
well defined sheep tracks ascending the steep slopes of the
fuljes spirally, and these I was assured were by no means
recent.&nbsp; Moreover, the levelled track made according to
tradition by Abu Zeyd is still discernible in places where
cuttings were originally made.&nbsp; Sticks and stones left in
the Nef&ucirc;d by travellers, the bones of camels and even their
droppings, remain for years uncovered, and those who cross do so
by the knowledge of landmarks constantly the same.&nbsp; I am
inclined to think, then, that the Nef&ucirc;ds represent a state
of comparative repose in Nature.&nbsp; Either the prevailing
winds which heaped them up formerly are less violent now than
then, or the fuljes are due to exceptional causes which have not
occurred for <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>many years.&nbsp; That wind in some form, and at some
time, has been their cause I do not doubt, but the exact method
of its action I will not affect to determine.&nbsp; Mr.
Blandford, an authority on these subjects, suggests that the
fuljes are spaces still unfilled with sand; and if this be so,
the strings of fuljes may in reality mark the site of such bare
strips as one finds in the intermittent Nef&ucirc;ds.&nbsp; It is
conceivable that as the spaces between the sand ridges grew
narrower, the wind blocked between them acquired such a rotatory
motion as to have thrown bridges of sand across, and so, little
by little, filled up all spaces but these.&nbsp; But to me no
theory that has been suggested is quite satisfactory.&nbsp; What
cause is it that keeps the floors of the deeper fuljes bare;
floors so narrow that it would seem a single gale should
obliterate them, or even the gradual slipping of the sand slopes
above them?&nbsp; There must be some continuous cause to keep
these bare.&nbsp; Yet where is the cause now in action sufficient
to have heaped up such walls or dug out such pits?</p>
<p>Another strange phenomenon is that of such places as
Jobba.&nbsp; There, in the middle of the Nef&ucirc;d, without
apparent reason, the sand is pushed high back on all sides from a
low central plain of bare ground three or four miles
across.&nbsp; North, south, east, and west the sand rises round
it in mountains 400 and 500 feet high, but the plain itself is
bare as a threshing-floor.&nbsp; It would seem as if this red
sand could not rest in a hollow place, and that the fact of
Jobba&rsquo;s low level alone kept it free.&nbsp; Jobba, if
cleared of sand all round, would, I have no doubt, present the
same feature as J&ocirc;f or Taibetism.&nbsp; It would appear as
a basin sunk in the plain, an ancient receptacle of the drainage
from Mount Aja.&nbsp; Has it only in recent times been surrounded
thus with sand?&nbsp; There is a tradition still extant there of
running water.</p>
<p><i>Jebel Shammar</i>.&mdash;A little north of latitude
29&deg;, the <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>Nef&ucirc;d ceases as suddenly as it began.&nbsp; The
stony plain reappears unchanged geologically, but more broken by
the proximity of a lofty range of hills, the Jebel Aja.&nbsp;
Between these, however, and the sand, there is an interval of at
least five miles where the soil is of sandstone, mostly red, the
material out of which the Nef&ucirc;d sand was made, but mixed
with a still coarser sand washed down from the granite
range.&nbsp; This rises rapidly to the foot of the hills.&nbsp;
There, with little preliminary warning, we come upon
unmistakeable red granite cropping in huge rounded masses out of
the plain, and rising to a height of 1000 and 1500 feet.&nbsp;
The shape of these rocks is very fantastic, boulder being set on
boulder in enormous pinnacles; and I noticed that many of them
were pierced with those round holes one finds in granite.&nbsp;
The texture of the rock is coarse, and precisely similar to that
of Jebel Musa in the Sina&iuml; peninsula, as is the scanty
vegetation with which the wadys are clothed.&nbsp; There are the
same thorny acacia, and the wild palm, and the caper plant as
there, and I heard of the same animals inhabiting the hills.</p>
<p>The <i>Jebel Aja</i> range has a main direction of E. by N.
and W. by S.&nbsp; Of this I am convinced by the observations I
was able to take when approaching it from the N.W.&nbsp; The
weather was clear and I was able to see its peaks running for
many miles in the direction mentioned.&nbsp; With regard to its
length I should put it, by the accounts I heard, at something
like 100 miles, and its average breadth may possibly be 10 or
15.&nbsp; In this I differ from the German geographers, who give
Jebel Aja a direction of N.E. by S.W., on the authority I believe
of Wallin.&nbsp; But as they also place Ha&iuml;l on the southern
slope of the hills, a gross error, I do not consider the
discrepancy as of any importance.</p>
<p>Of <i>Jebel Selman</i>, I can only speak according to the
distant view I had of it.&nbsp; But I should be much surprised <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>to learn
that any portion of it passed west of the latitude of
Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; That portion of it visible from Ha&iuml;l
certainly lies to the S.E., and at an apparent distance of 30
miles, with no indication of its being continued westwards.&nbsp;
It is by all accounts of the same rock (red granite) as Jebel
Aja.</p>
<p>Between Jebel Selman and the Nef&ucirc;d lie several isolated
hills rising from broken ground.&nbsp; All these are of the
sandstone formation of the Ham&aacute;d, and have no geological
connection with Aja or Selman.&nbsp; Such are Jebels Jildiyeh,
Yatubb, and Jilfeh, Jildiyeh the tallest having a height of
perhaps 3800 feet above the sea, or 300 above Ha&iuml;l.</p>
<p>Ha&iuml;l lies due east of the extreme eastern buttress of
Jebel Aja, and not south of it as has been supposed.&nbsp; Both
it and Kefar, as indeed all the towns and villages of the
district, lie in a single broad wady, draining the south-eastern
rocks of Aja, and sweeping round them northwards to the
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; The height of Ha&iuml;l is 3,500 feet above
the sea, and the plain rises southwards behind it, almost
imperceptibly.&nbsp; The small isolated hills close to the town,
belong, I think, geologically to the granite range.&nbsp; The
main drainage of the plain south of Ha&iuml;l would seem to be
received by the Wady Hannasy, whose course is north, so that the
highest part of the plain is probably between Aja and Selman, and
may be as much as 4,000 feet above the sea.&nbsp; This, I take
it, is the highest plateau of Arabia&mdash;as Aja is its highest
mountain, 5000 to 5600 feet,&mdash;an all sufficient reason for
including Jebel Shammar in the term Nejd or Highland.</p>
<p>I feel that I am taking a very serious liberty with
geographers in placing Ha&iuml;l 60 miles farther south than
where it is found in our modern maps.&nbsp; I consider, however,
that until its position has been scientifically determined, I am
justified in doing this by the fact, that my dead reckoning gave
it this position, not only according to the out journey, but by
the return one, measured from Meshhed <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Ali.&nbsp; I am so much in the habit
of measuring distances by a rough computation of pace and time,
that I doubt if I am much out in the present instance.&nbsp; On
this, however, I forbear to dogmatise.</p>
<p>I had hoped to conclude this sketch with a list of plants
found in the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; But our small collection has
proved to be so pulverised by its journey, that Sir Joseph
Hooker, who kindly undertook to look over it, has been able to
identify hardly half-a-dozen specimens.</p>
<p>Of wild animals, I have ascertained the existence of the
ostrich, the leopard, the wolf, the fox, the hy&aelig;na, the
hare, the jerboa, the white antelope, and the gazelle in the
Nef&ucirc;d; and of the ibex and the marmot in Jebel Aja.&nbsp;
Of these it may be remarked that the ostrich is the most valuable
and perhaps the most rare; I had not the luck to see a single
wild specimen, though once a fresh egg was brought me.&nbsp;
Neither did I see, except in confinement, the white antelope
(Oryx beatrix), which is the most important quadruped of the
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; This antelope frequents every part of the red
sand desert, and I found its track quite one hundred miles from
any spring, so that the Arabs may be pardoned for affirming that
it never drinks.&nbsp; The hare too is found and plentifully
throughout; but the gazelle haunts only the outskirts within
reach of the hills or of wells where the Arabs are accustomed to
water their flocks.&nbsp; The same may be said of the wolf, the
fox, and the hy&aelig;na, which seem fairly abundant.&nbsp; The
tracks of these grew frequent as we approached Jebel Aja, and it
may be assumed that it is there they have their lairs, making use
of the Nef&ucirc;d as a hunting ground.&nbsp; The Jebel Aja, a
granite range not less than 5,500 feet above the sea, furnishes
the water required by these animals, not indeed in streams, for
none such are found in the range, but in springs and natural
tanks where rain water is stored.&nbsp; These seem by all
accounts to be fairly numerous; and if <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>so, the
ancient tradition of a wild horse having also been found in the
Nef&ucirc;d, may not be so improbable as at first sight it
seems.&nbsp; There is certainly pasture and good pasture for the
horse in every part of it.&nbsp; The sheep of the Nef&ucirc;d
requires water but once in a month, and the Nef&ucirc;d horse may
have required no more.</p>
<p>Of reptiles the Nef&ucirc;d boasts by all accounts the horned
viper and the cobra, besides the harmless grey snake called
Suliman, which is common everywhere.&nbsp; There are also immense
numbers of lizards.</p>
<p>Birds are less numerous, but I noticed the frilled bustard
Houbara, and one or two hawks and buzzards.&nbsp; A large black
buzzard was especially plentiful.&nbsp; The Bedouins of Nejd
train the Lanner falcon, the only noble hawk they possess, to
take hares and bustards.&nbsp; In the Nef&ucirc;d, most of the
common desert birds are found, the desert lark, the wheatear, and
a kind of wren which inhabits the ghada and yerta bushes.</p>
<p>Of insects I noticed the dragon-fly, several beetles, the
common house-fly, and ants, whose nests, made of some glutinous
substance mixed with sand, may be seen under these bushes.&nbsp;
I was also interested at finding, sunning itself on the rocks of
Aalem, a specimen of the painted lady butterfly, so well known
for its adventurous flights.&nbsp; This insect could not well
have been bred at any nearer point than Syria or the Euphrates,
respectively 400 and 300 miles distant.&nbsp; Fleas do not exist
beyond the Nef&ucirc;d, and our dogs became free of them as soon
as we reached Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; Locusts were incredibly numerous
everywhere, and formed the chief article of food for man, beast,
and bird.&nbsp; They are of two colours, red and green, the
latter being I believe the male, while the former is the
female.&nbsp; They both are excellent eating, but the red locust
is preferred.</p>
<p>Sand-storms are probably less common in the Nef&ucirc;d than
in deserts where the sand is white, for reasons already <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>named; nor
do the Bedouins seem much to dread them.&nbsp; They are only
dangerous where they last long enough to delay travellers far
from home beyond the time calculated on for their supplies.&nbsp;
No tales are told of caravans overwhelmed or even single
persons.&nbsp; Those who perish in the Nef&ucirc;d perish of
thirst.&nbsp; I made particular inquiries as to the simoom or
poisonous wind mentioned by Mr. Palgrave, but could gain no
information respecting it.</p>
<p>In the Jebel Aja an ibex is found, specimens of which I saw at
Ha&iuml;l, and a mountain gazelle, and I heard of a leopard,
probably the same as that found in Sina&iuml;.&nbsp; The only
animal there, which may be new, is one described to me as the
Webber, an animal of the size of the hare, which climbs the wild
palms and eats the dates.&nbsp; It is described as sitting on its
legs and whistling, and from the description I judged it to be a
marmot or a coney (hierax).&nbsp; But Lord Lilford, whom I spoke
to on the subject, assures me it is in all probability the
Lophiomys Imhausii.</p>

251</span>HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE RISE AND DECLINE OF WAHHABISM
IN ARABIA.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Compiled principally from Materials
supplied by Lt.-Colonel E. C. Ross, H.M.&rsquo;s Resident at
Bushire</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of last century,
Nejd, and Arabia generally, with the exception of Oman, Yemen,
and Hejaz, was divided into a number of independent districts or
townships, each ruled by a tribal chief on the principle already
explained of self-government under Bedouin protection.&nbsp;
Religion, except in its primitive Arabian form, was almost
forgotten by the townspeople, and little if any connection was
kept up between them and the rest of the Mahometan world.</p>
<p>In 1691, however, Mohammed Ibn Abd-el-Wahhab, founder of the
Wahhabi sect, was born at Eiyanah in Aared, his father being of
the Ibn Temim tribe, the same which till lately held power in
Jebel Shammar.&nbsp; In his youth he went to Bussorah, and
perhaps to Damascus, to study religious law, and after making the
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina returned to his native country,
and soon after married in the village of Horeylama near
Deriyeh.&nbsp; There and at Eyaneh he began his preaching, and
about the year 1742 succeeded in converting Mohammed Ibn Saoud,
Emir of Deriyeh, the principal town of Aared.</p>
<p>The chief features of his teaching were:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; The re-establishment of Mahometan beliefs as taught
<a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>by the
Koran, and the rejection of those other beliefs accepted by the
Sunis on tradition.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; A denial of all spiritual authority to the Ottoman
or any other Caliph, and of all special respect due to sherifs,
saints, dervishes, or other persons.</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; The restoration of discipline in the matter of
prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage.</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; A strict prohibition of wine, tobacco, games of
chance, magic, silk and gold in dress, and of tombstones for the
dead.</p>
<p>Ibn Abd-el-Wahhab lived to an advanced age at Deriyeh, and
died in 1787.</p>
<p>Mohammed Ibn Saoud, the first Wahhabi Emir, belonged to the
Mesalikh tribe of &Aacute;nazeh, itself an offshoot of the Welled
Ali of western Nejd (deriving, according to the account of the
Ibn Saouds themselves, from the Beni Bekr Wail, through Maane Ibn
Rabiia, king of Nejd, Hasa and Oman in the 15th century).&nbsp;
He embraced the tenets of Abd-el-Wahhab, as has been said, in the
year 1742, and was followed in his conversion by many of the
inhabitants of Deriyeh and the neighbouring districts, who at
last so swelled the number of Ibn Saoud&rsquo;s adherents, that
he became the head of the reformed religion, and according to the
Wahhabi pretensions the head of all Islam.&nbsp; Guided by the
counsels of Ibn Abd-el-Wahhab, and carried forward on the wave of
the new teaching, he gradually established his authority over all
Aared and eventually over the greater part of Nejd.&nbsp; His
hardest contests there were with the people of Riad, who, under
their Sheykh, Mohammed Ibn Daus, long held out, and with the Ibn
Ghureyr (Areyr or Aruk), Sheykhs of the Beni Khaled.&nbsp; These
latter, who owned the districts of Hasa and Katif, though forced
to tribute, have always been hostile to the Ibn Saouds, and are
so at the present day.&nbsp; Another opponent, bitterly hostile
to the new religion, was the Emir&rsquo;s brother, <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>Theniyan,
whose descendants still belong to the anti-Wahhabi faction in
Aared.&nbsp; Mohammed Ibn Saoud died in 1765 and was succeeded by
his son Abdel Aziz.</p>
<p>Abd-el-Aziz Ibn Saoud, a man of energy and ambition, completed
the subjugation of Nejd and Hasa, and carried the Wahhabi arms as
far northwards as Bussorah, and even it would seem to Mesopotamia
and the Sinjar Hills.&nbsp; These latter raids so greatly alarmed
the government of the Sultan, that in 1798 a Turkish
expeditionary force was sent by land from Bagdad into Hasa, under
the command of one Ali Pasha, secretary to Suliman Pasha the
Turkish Valy.&nbsp; It consisted of 4000 or 5000 regular
infantry, with artillery, and a large contingent of Bedouin Arabs
collected from the Montefik, Daffir, and other tribes hostile to
the Wahhabi power.&nbsp; These marched down the coast and took
possession of the greater part of Hasa, but having failed to
reduce Hofhuf, a fortified town, were returning northwards when
their retreat was intercepted by Saoud, the Emir&rsquo;s son, who
took up a position under the walls of Taj.&nbsp; A battle was
then imminent, but it was averted by the mediation of the Arab
Sheykhs, and Ali Pasha was allowed to continue his retreat to
Bussorah, while Saoud retook possession of Hasa and punished
those who had submitted to the Turks.&nbsp; This affair
contributed much to the extension and renown of the Wahhabi
power; and offers of submission came in from all sides.&nbsp; The
Emir, nevertheless, thought it prudent to endeavour to conciliate
the Turkish Valy, and despatched horses and other valuable
presents to Bagdad.</p>
<p>The Wahhabi State was now become a regular Government, with a
centralised administration, a system of tax instead of tribute,
and a standing army which marched under the command of Saoud Ibn
Saoud, the Emir&rsquo;s eldest son.&nbsp; The Emir, Abd-el-Aziz
himself, appears to have been a man of peace, simple in his dress
and habits, and extremely devout.&nbsp; Saoud, however, was a
warrior, and it was <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>through him that the Wahhabis pushed
their fortunes.&nbsp; There seems, nevertheless, to have been
always a strong party of opposition in the desert, where the
Bedouins clung to the traditions of their independence and chafed
under the religious discipline imposed on them.&nbsp; Kasim and
Jebel Shammar, both of them centres of Bedouin life, never
accepted the Wahhabi tenets with any enthusiasm, and the people
of Hasa, an industrious race standing in close commercial
relations with Persia, accepted the rule of the Ibn Saouds only
on compulsion.&nbsp; Southern Nejd alone seems to have been
fanatically Wahhabi, but their fanaticism was their strength and
long carried all before it.</p>
<p>In 1799, Saoud made his first pilgrimage to Mecca, at the head
of 4000 armed followers, and in the following year he repeated
the act of piety.&nbsp; Passage through Nejd, however, seems to
have been forbidden to the Shiah pilgrims whom the Wahhabis
regarded as infidels, and a violent feeling was roused against
the Wahhabis in Persia and in the Pashalik of Bagdad, where most
of the inhabitants are Shiahs.&nbsp; It ended in the
assassination of the Emir Abd-el-Aziz by a Persian seyyid from
Kerbela, in 1800, at the age of 82 years.&nbsp; (Colonel Ross
gives 1803 as the date of this event, but, according to members
of the Ibn Saoud family themselves, it happened three years
earlier; a date which accords better with other events.)</p>
<p>In 1801, a first expedition was despatched against Oman under
Selim-el-Hark, one of Saoud&rsquo;s lieutenants; and in the same
year Saoud himself, to avenge his father&rsquo;s murder, marched
northwards with 20,000 men to the Euphrates, and on the 20th of
April sacked Kerbela, whence, having put all the male inhabitants
to the sword and razed the tomb of Husseyn, he retired the same
afternoon with an immense booty.&nbsp; The success of this
attack, made in the name of a reformed Islam upon the stronghold
of the Shiah heretics and within the nominal dominions of the <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>Sultan,
spread consternation throughout the Mussulman world.</p>
<p>In 1802 the island of Bahreyn was reduced to tribute, and the
Wahhabi power extended down the Eastern coast as far as Batinah
on the Sea of Oman, and several of the Oman tribes embraced the
Wahhabi faith, and became tributary to Ibn Saoud.</p>
<p>In 1803, a quarrel having occurred between the Wahhabi Emir
and Ghalib the Sherif of Mecca, Saoud marched into Hejaz with a
large army, reduced Taif, and on the 1st of May entered Mecca,
where he deposed the Sherif and appointed a Governor of his
own.&nbsp; He did not, however, appear there as an enemy but as a
pilgrim, and his troops were restrained from plunder, the only
act of violence permitted being the destruction of the large
tombs in the city, so that, as they themselves said, &ldquo;there
did not remain an idol in all that pure city.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
they abolished the taxes and customs; destroyed all instruments
for the use of tobacco and the dwellings of those who sold
hashish or who lived in open wickedness.&nbsp; Saoud returned to
Nejd, having received the submission of all Central Arabia,
including the holy city of Medina.&nbsp; This may be considered
as the zenith of the Wahhabi power.&nbsp; Law and order prevailed
under a central government, and the Emir on his return to Deriyeh
issued a proclamation promising strict protection of life,
property, and commerce throughout his dominions.&nbsp; This
fortunate state of things continued for several years.</p>
<p>In 1807 Saoud once more marched to the Euphrates and laid
siege to Meshhed Ali, but failed to capture that walled town and
was forced to retreat.</p>
<p>In 1809 he collected an army of 30,000 men with the intention
of attacking Bagdad, but disturbances having broken out in Nejd
he abandoned his intention and marched instead with his army on
pilgrimage to Mecca, whence he returned home by Medina, now
annexed to his empire.</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>In
Oman the Wahhabi arms continued to gain ground, and their name
seems first to have become known in India in connexion with
piratical raids committed on the Indian Sea.&nbsp; This led to an
expedition undertaken in 1809 by the English against
Ras-el-Kheymah on the Persian Gulf.&nbsp; But in spite of this,
the Wahhabis advanced next year to Mattrah, a few miles only from
Muscat, and to Bahreyn, which was occupied by them and received a
Wahhabi governor.</p>
<p>In 1810 Saoud invaded Irak, and in 1811 his son Abdallah
arrived close to Bagdad on a plundering raid, while another
Wahhabi army, under Abu Nocta, a slave of the Emir&rsquo;s,
invaded Syria and held Damascus to ransom.&nbsp; In Syria,
indeed, for some years tribute had been paid by the desert towns
of the Hauran and the districts east of Jordan to Nejd; and it
seemed probable that the new Arabian Empire would extend itself
to the Mediterranean, and Abd-el-Wahhabi&rsquo;s reformation to
all the Arab race.&nbsp; A coalition of the Northern Bedouins,
however, under Eddrehi Ibn Shaalan, Sheykh of the Roala, saved
Damascus from Abu Nocta, and after sustaining a defeat from them
on the Orontes the Wahhabi army returned to Nejd.</p>
<p>The danger, however, to orthodox Islam was now recognized, and
in the same year, 1811, the Ottoman Sultan, urged by his Suni
subjects to recover the holy places of Arabia to orthodox
keeping, resolved on serious measures against Nejd.&nbsp; Matters
had been brought to a crisis the year before by an act of
fanaticism on the part of Saoud which had roused the indignation
of all sects in Islam against him.&nbsp; On the occasion of a
fourth pilgrimage which he had then made, he had caused the tomb
of the prophet to be opened at Medina and the rich jewels and
precious relics it contained to be sold or distributed among his
soldiers, an act of sacrilege which it was impossible to
tolerate.&nbsp; The Sultan was reminded that one of the claims <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>on which
his ancestors of the House of Ottoman rested their tenure to the
Caliphate was that they possessed the Holy Places, and he was
called upon to assert his protectorate of Mecca and Medina by
force.&nbsp; It is probable, indeed, that only the great
interests at stake in Europe during the previous years of the
century had delayed vigorous action.&nbsp; The invasion of Egypt
by Napoleon, and the disorganisation of the Turkish Empire
resulting from it, had contributed not a little to the Wahhabi
successes.&nbsp; Now, however, Egypt was under the rule of
Mehemet Ali, and to his vigorous hands the Sultan entrusted the
duty of punishing the Ibn Saouds.&nbsp; The absence of the
Emir&rsquo;s armies in the north gave a favourable opportunity to
the Egyptian arms, a force of 8000 men was despatched to Hejaz,
and Mecca was occupied by Tusun Pasha without resistance.&nbsp;
On advancing inland, however, beyond Taif, Tusun was met by
Abdullah Ibn Saoud, and defeated in the desert with the loss of
half his army; nor was he able to do more than hold his own in
Mecca until relieved from Egypt.</p>
<p>In 1813, Mehemet Ali, impatient of his son&rsquo;s failure,
went in person to Arabia, and seized Ghalib the Sherif, whom he
suspected of Wahhabism, at Mecca and sent him prisoner to
Cairo.&nbsp; Tusun was again entrusted with the command of an
expedition destined for Nejd, but was again met and defeated
beyond Taif in the spring of 1814.</p>
<p>In April 1814, while preparations were being pressed for a
renewal of the campaign, Saoud Ibn Saoud the Wahhabi Emir, died,
and Abdallah, his son and recognized successor, was acknowledged
without opposition, chief of the Wahhabis.</p>
<p>In January 1815, Mehemet Ali inflicted a first serious defeat
on the Wahhabi army, and Tusun having occupied Medina advanced
into Kasim, in northern Nejd, where <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>he took possession of Ras, at that
time capital of the district.</p>
<p>Negotiations were opened from that point with the Emir
Abdallah who had retired with his army to Aneyzeh; and these
resulted to the astonishment of every one (for Abdallah still had
a powerful army) in the Emir&rsquo;s submission.</p>
<p>It is probable that in thus yielding, Abdallah felt his
position in Nejd insecure.&nbsp; The Bedouins though subdued had
never accepted the Wahhabi rule but on compulsion, and many of
them were openly siding with the Turks, while his late defeat had
destroyed much of his soldier&rsquo;s prestige.&nbsp; Be that as
it may, the Emir agreed to the following stringent terms at
Aneyzeh.</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; He acknowledged as suzerain the Sultan of
Turkey.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; He agreed to give hostages for future conduct, and
even, if required, to present himself in person at
Constantinople.</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; He would deliver over Deriyeh, his capital, to a
governor appointed by the Sultan; and</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; He would restore the jewels plundered from Medina
on the occasion of his father&rsquo;s visit in 1810.</p>
<p>On these conditions peace was concluded between the Emir and
Tusun, and Abdallah gave the hostages required.&nbsp; He did not,
however, give over Deriyeh, but proceeded on the contrary to
prepare it for a siege.&nbsp; Neither did Mehemet Ali, when he
learned that Abdallah refused to come to Egypt in person, nullify
the peace.&nbsp; Tusun was recalled, and Ibrahim, his second son,
appointed commander of the army in Arabia in his stead.</p>
<p>In September 1816 Ibrahim Pasha left Egypt at the head of a
considerable force and proceeded to the scene of action.</p>
<p>The first encounter seems to have taken place at Ma&rsquo;
Wiyah, where Abdallah ibn Saoud attacked the Egyptian <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>army and
suffered a signal defeat.&nbsp; On this occasion Ibrahim Pasha
put to death all prisoners taken.&nbsp; The pasha then advanced
with 4000 infantry and 1200 cavalry, besides contingents of the
friendly Arab tribes, Beni-Kh&aacute;led, Muteyr, &rsquo;Oteybah,
Harb, and Suhool against Ras, which was held by a Wahhabi
garrison.&nbsp; Before this town Ibrahim Pasha suffered a serious
check, and after besieging it for three and a half months, and
losing 3000 men, he was obliged to agree to an armistice and
abandon the siege.&nbsp; The Egyptian general, however, masking
Ras, continued to advance eastwards on &rsquo;Aneyzah and the
Emir retired south to Bereydah.&nbsp; After six days&rsquo;
bombardments, the forts of &rsquo;Aneyzah surrendered, and the
entire district of Kasim then submitted to the Egyptian
commander.&nbsp; Abdallah retired on Shakrah, a town in the
district of Woshem, and Ibrahim Pasha took Bereydah, where he
halted two months for reinforcements.&nbsp; During this time the
pasha succeeded in detaching from the Wahhabi cause many of those
Bedouins who still remained faithful to Ibn Saoud.&nbsp; Among
the first to join the Egyptians had been Feysul-el-Dawish, Sheikh
of the Muteyr, who, animated by an ancient feud with the Ibn
Saouds, was readily persuaded by Ibrahim with the promise of
being installed Governor of Nejd, a promise which the pasha had
no intention of fulfilling.</p>
<p>Having received at Bereydah a reinforcement of 800 men, and
two guns, as well as supplies of provisions and ammunition,
Ibrahim Pasha was able to continue his advance on Shakrah at the
head of 4500 Turkish, Albanian, and Moorish troops in addition to
Arab contingents.&nbsp; About 10,000 camels accompanied the
force, and the infantry soldiers were usually mounted two and two
on camels.&nbsp; The Emir Abdallah meantime retired on his
capital, wasting the country before the enemy, and sending the
surplus cattle and flocks to Hasa.&nbsp; This was in the latter
<a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>part of
December, 1817.&nbsp; In the following month the Turkish army
appeared before Shakrah, which was regularly approached under the
direction of a French engineer, M. Vaissi&egrave;re, and
capitulated on the 22nd of January, 1818.&nbsp; The lives of the
garrison were spared, but they were deprived of their arms, and
had to engage not to serve again under the Wahhabi Emir.&nbsp;
Some time after, when Deriyeh had fallen, Ibrahim Pasha caused
the fortifications of Shakrah to be demolished.</p>
<p>Abdallah ibn Saoud had now retreated to Deriyeh and before
following him up to the capital Ibrahim Pasha judged it advisable
to turn aside from the direct route to take the town of
Dhoramah.&nbsp; At that place he encountered a spirited
resistance, several of his men being killed.&nbsp; In revenge for
this, the male inhabitants were put to the sword, the town
pillaged and destroyed, and the women given up to the brutality
of the Turkish soldiery.&nbsp; Only the governor and his guard,
who had shut themselves in a citadel, were suffered to escape
with their lives.</p>
<p>Detained by rains, it was March before Ibrahim Pasha advanced
on Deriyeh which town he invested in April with a force of 5500
horse and foot and twelve pieces of artillery, including two
mortars and two howitzers.&nbsp; Shortly after, reinforcements
and convoys of supplies reached the Turkish camp from Medina and
Busrah.&nbsp; The siege operations were for some time conducted
without any success to the Turkish arms, and in the latter part
of the month of May an explosion having occurred by which the
pasha lost all his spare ammunition, his position became
extremely critical.&nbsp; Indeed, the indomitable personal
courage and good example of Ibrahim alone saved the army from
disaster.&nbsp; The troops suffered much from dysentery and
ophthalmia, and the Wahhabis thought to overwhelm the besiegers
by a sortie in force.&nbsp; The attack was however repulsed and
the opportunity lost <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>to the besieged; for soon after the
engagement caravans with fresh supplies of ammunition and
provisions reached the Egyptian camp, and then reinforcements of
infantry and cavalry.&nbsp; News was also received of the
approach of Khalil Pasha from Egypt with 3000 fresh troops.&nbsp;
Early in September the Emir sent a flag of truce to request an
audience of the pasha.&nbsp; This was accorded, and the Wahhabi
chief was kindly received, but was informed that the first and
indispensable condition of peace was the attendance of Abdallah
in person at Cairo.&nbsp; The Emir asked twenty four hours for
reflection, which delay was granted, and at the expiration of the
time he returned to the pasha&rsquo;s camp and intimated his
willingness to fulfil the condition imposed, provided Ibrahim
would guarantee that his life would be spared.&nbsp; Ibrahim
Pasha replied that he had no authority himself to bind the Sultan
and the Viceroy on that point, but that he thought both were too
generous to put him to death.&nbsp; Abdallah then pleaded for his
family and prayed that Deriyeh and his adherents there should be
spared.&nbsp; These terms were conceded and a peace
concluded.&nbsp; The ill-starred Emir at once set out on his
journey under a strong escort, and on reaching Cairo, was
courteously received by Mehemet Ali, who forwarded him to
Constantinople with a strong appeal for his pardon.&nbsp; The
government of the Porte was, however, implacable: Abdallah ibn
Saoud was paraded ignominiously through the streets of the
capital for three days, and then, with his companions in
captivity, was publicly beheaded.</p>
<p>Thus ends the first epoch of the Wahhabi rule in Nejd.&nbsp;
During the twenty-three years which followed the destruction of
Deriyeh, Nejd continued to be a province of Egypt; sometimes
occupied by Egyptian troops, sometimes tributary only.&nbsp; When
Ibrahim Pasha first appeared in Nejd, he commanded the sympathies
of a great part of the population, and especially in Jebel
Shammar, Kasim, <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>and Hasa, where he was received rather as a deliverer
from the Wahhabi yoke, than as a foreign conqueror.&nbsp; No
Turkish army had previously been seen in Central Arabia; and the
Arabs of the interior, when not fanatically biased, had no
special hatred of them.&nbsp; But the Turkish and Albanian troops
left in garrison by Ibrahim soon excited by their cruelties the
enmity of the people; and as early as 1822 a first massacre of a
Turkish garrison occurred at Riad, the new capital of Nejd (for
Deriyeh was never rebuilt).&nbsp; This was followed in 1823 and
1824 by a successful rising of the Arabs under Turki ibn Saoud
(see pedigree), and the re-establishment of his family as
sovereign in Aared.&nbsp; Turki seized Riad, drove out the
Egyptian troops still remaining in Nejd, and as leader of a
popular movement against the foreigner, was recognized Emir by
most of the tribes of Central Arabia.</p>
<p>For ten years&mdash;1824 to 1834&mdash;Turki consolidated his
power in Nejd, Hasa, and even Oman, the whole coast of the
Persian Gulf to Ras-el-Had acknowledging him and paying
tribute.&nbsp; He, however, himself paid tribute to the
Government of Egypt, which accorded countenance to his action in
Arabia.</p>
<p>In 1834, Turki ibn Saoud was assassinated by a relative,
Meshari, who was in turn put to death by Turki&rsquo;s son,
Feysul, now recognised Emir in his father&rsquo;s stead.</p>
<p>In 1838, Feysul, having neglected or refused to pay tribute to
Egypt, Mehemet Ali sent a force under Jomail Bey to depose him,
and to establish Khalid, a rival claimant of the Ibn Saoud
family, as Emir at Riad.&nbsp; Feysul then fled to Hasa, and
Khalid, supported by a portion of the people of Aared and by
reinforcements from Egypt under Khurshid Pasha, usurped the
throne, but was shortly set aside by the Egyptian commanders, who
established Egyptian government throughout Nejd.&nbsp; Feysul
meanwhile had surrendered to them, and been sent prisoner to
Cairo.&nbsp; The <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>second Egyptian occupation of Nejd lasted for two
years.&nbsp; Then the greater part of the troops were recalled,
and Khalid left as Valy for the Turkish government.</p>
<p>In 1842, Abdallah ibn Theneyan ibn Saoud headed a revolt
against Khalid, who with his few remaining Egyptian troops was
ejected from Riad; and Feysul, having escaped from his prison in
Cairo, reappeared in Aared, and was everywhere acknowledged as
Emir.&nbsp; From this time neither the Egyptian nor the Turkish
government have exercised any authority in Nejd.</p>
<p>Under Feysul, whose reign lasted after his restoration for
twenty-three years, nearly all the former territories of the
Wahhabi empire were re-conquered.&nbsp; Oman in 1845 was reduced
to tribute; Hasa was forced to accept Wahhabi governors, and in
Feysul&rsquo;s last years Kasim also was conquered.&nbsp; Jebel
Shammar, which on the overthrow of the first Nejd empire by
Ibrahim Pasha had reverted to independence under the Ibn Ali
family of the Beni Temim, was now also annexed nominally to the
Wahhabi state.&nbsp; With Feysul&rsquo;s help, Abdallah ibn
Rashid, Sheykh of the Shammar, established himself at Ha&iuml;l,
and paying tribute to the Emir acknowledged his
sovereignty.&nbsp; Only in Bahreyn were his arms unsuccessful,
and that owing to the support given to the Bahreyn sheykhs by
England.</p>
<p>In the later years of his life Feysul became blind, and the
management of affairs fell to his son Abdallah, who by his
fanaticism and his cruelty alienated the Bedouin population from
his standard, and prepared matters for a third intervention on
the part of the Turks.</p>
<p>Before narrating, however, the last episode of Arabian
misfortune and Turkish annexation, it will be necessary to
explain briefly the views and pretensions of the Ottoman Sultans
with respect to Arabia.</p>
<p>The first appearance of the Turks in the peninsula dates from
1524, when Selim I., having conquered Egypt and <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>usurped the
Caliphate, till then held by members of the Abbaside family, took
military possession of the holy places, Mecca and Medina, and
annexed Yemen to his dominions.&nbsp; Beyond the districts
immediately bordering on the Red Sea, however, no part of Arabia
proper was at that time claimed by the Sultans; and in the
following century a national insurrection drove them even from
these, so that with the exception of the pilgrim roads from Cairo
and Damascus, the Turks made no pretension of being masters in
the Peninsula.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Pasha&rsquo;s expedition had been made not in
assertion of a sovereign right, but as an act of chastisement and
retaliation on a hostile sect; and once the Wahhabi government
crushed, little care had been taken in retaining Nejd as a
possession.&nbsp; The sultans were at that time far too anxiously
occupied with their position in Europe to indulge in dreams of
conquest in Asia, and were, from a military point of view, too
weak for unprofitable enterprises not absolutely necessary.&nbsp;
But at the close of the Crimean war the Turkish army was
thoroughly reorganised, thanks to the English loan, which made
its equipment with arms of precision possible; and the Sultan,
finding himself in the possession of unaccustomed power, used it
for the reduction first of the outlying districts of the Empire
which had shaken off his yoke, and next of those tribes on its
borders which appeared easiest of conquest.&nbsp; The frontier
lands of Syria and Kurdistan were thus brought back into
subjection, the Euphrates and Tigris valleys, independent since
the days of Tamerlane, were occupied in force, and Irak was once
more placed under the Imperial system of tax and
conscription.&nbsp; The Suez Canal was opened, and Arabia,
accessible hitherto by land only, was now for the first time
within easy reach of Constantinople.&nbsp; With the sense of
increased power, born of full coffers and an army ready and
equipped for action, <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>new dreams of conquest came to the
Imperial government.&nbsp; The Sultan remembered what he seemed
to have forgotten, that he was heir to the Arabian caliphate, and
his Ministers of the day based on this fact a claim to all
Arabia.&nbsp; The garrisons of Mecca and the Hejaz were
increased, an expedition was despatched against Yemen, and Midhat
Pasha, a man of a restless, unquiet temper, was appointed
Governor of Bagdad, with orders to watch his time for extending
the Sultan&rsquo;s influence in any direction that might seem to
him advisable.&nbsp; The opportunity soon came.</p>
<p>In 1865 Feysul ibn Saoud died, and the Wahhabi State which
under him had regained so much of its former power, was once more
weakened by internal dissension.&nbsp; Feysul left two sons,
Abdallah and Saoud, the former a strict Wahhabi, but the latter
holding liberal opinions, national rather than religious.&nbsp;
Each put himself at the head of a party; Abdallah of the townsmen
in Aared who were still fanatically attached to the reformed
doctrine, and Saoud of the Bedouins.&nbsp; For a while they
divided Feysul&rsquo;s inheritance between them, but coming to
blows the younger brother forced the elder to fly from Aared, and
Saoud established himself there as sole Emir.&nbsp; Jebel Shammar
meanwhile and Kasim became completely independent, and Hasa and
the rest of the maritime districts refused any longer to pay
tribute.</p>
<p>In 1871 Abdallah, turned out of Aared, made his way with a few
followers to Jebel Shammar, where Metaab Ibn Rashid was then
Emir, and from that asylum (for he was treated there as a guest)
put himself into communication with Midhat at Bagdad.&nbsp;
Midhat, who saw in this circumstance an opportunity such as he
had been instructed to seek, readily responded; and at once
issued a proclamation in which the sovereign power of the Sultan
over Nejd was assumed, and Abdallah referred to as Caimakam or
Deputy Governor of that province.&nbsp; It was notified,
moreover, that <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>a Turkish force would be despatched from Bagdad
&ldquo;to restore order, and to maintain the said Caimakam
against his rebellious brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some opposition on the part of the Indian Government,
which for many years had insisted upon absolute peace being
maintained in the Persian gulf, a rule which had been agreed to
by all the chiefs of the Arabian coast, including the people of
Hasa and the Wahhabi government, and which had been attended with
excellent results, a military expedition was despatched by sea to
Hasa.&nbsp; It consisted of 4000 to 5000 Turkish regulars, under
Nazfi Pasha, and disembarked at Katif in the month of June.&nbsp;
Abdallah in the meantime had returned to Nejd, and having
collected a body of adherents, in union with the Beni Kahtan
tribe, attacked Saoud from the west; but was defeated and took
refuge in the Turkish camp.</p>
<p>Dissensions nevertheless broke out in Riad and forced Saoud to
take the field against a third rival, Abdallah ibn Turki, at
whose hands he sustained a defeat, and he was in his turn forced
to retire to Katr.&nbsp; The Turks had now occupied all the
seaboard of Hasa, and the inland fort and town of Hofhuf, whence
they entered into communication with this Abdallah ibn Turki,
whom they named Mudir of Riad, &ldquo;pending the arrival there
of Abdallah ibn Feysul;&rdquo; but before the end of the year,
Midhat announced that in consequence of a petition received by
the Sultan from the principal inhabitants of Nejd <a
name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266"
class="citation">[266]</a> the Ibn Saoud family had ceased to
reign, and that the country should henceforth be administered by
a Turkish Governor.&nbsp; Nafiz Pasha was appointed in the same
announcement Muteserrif or Governor of Nejd, and Abdallah was
entirely put aside.&nbsp; The Emir Abdallah thereupon fled from
the Turkish camp in Hasa to Riad.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>In
1872 Raouf Pasha, who had succeeded Midhat at Bagdad, opened
negotiations with Saoud, and induced him to send his brother
Abderrahman to Bagdad, where he was retained a prisoner till
1874.</p>
<p>In the same year Saoud returned to Riad, and once more ejected
his brother Abdallah, who retired to Queyt, leaving Saoud in
undisturbed possession till his death in 1874.</p>
<p>In 1873, the Turkish regular troops were withdrawn, and Bizi
ibn Ar&eacute;ar, Sheykh of the Beni Kh&aacute;led and hereditary
enemy of the Ibn Saouds, was left in Hasa as Ottoman Governor,
with a garrison of zaptiehs.</p>
<p>In 1874, Abderrahman, brother of the Emir Saoud, having been
released from Bagdad, raised a revolt in Hasa, and was joined by
the Al Mowak, Ajman and other Bedouin tribes, with whom he
marched on Hofhuf and besieged Bizi there with his garrison, many
of whom were slain.&nbsp; Whereupon Nassr Pasha was sent from
Bussora with a battalion of regulars, by sea to Hasa, at the news
of whose approach Abderrahman retired to Riad.&nbsp; Nassr then
marched on Hofhuf and relieved the garrison, which were shut up
in the fort; but gave the town to pillage.&nbsp; For several days
the Turkish soldiers and their auxiliaries indulged in
indiscriminate massacre and plunder of the inhabitants; men,
women and children were shot down, and women were openly treated
with the brutality peculiar to such occasions.&nbsp; It is said
in extenuation that the Turkish officers remonstrated with the
Pasha, but that he replied that it was necessary to make an
example.</p>
<p>Shortly after this the Emir Saoud died at Riad, it has been
said of poison; and in 1875 Abdallah returned to Nejd, where he
found Abderrahman, his half brother, established.&nbsp; The
brothers, after some disputing, came to an amicable arrangement
with respect to the chief power, Abdallah holding the title of
Emir, and Abderrahman of chief minister.&nbsp; Such is now the
state of things at Riad.&nbsp; <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>Overtures from the Turkish
Government have been lately opened with the Emir, on the basis of
his becoming Governor of Nejd as Turkish nominee, but have met
with no response.&nbsp; Abdallah, it would seem, exercises little
authority out of Riad, and none whatever out of Aared.&nbsp; He
represents the party of Wahhabi fanaticism there, which is
rapidly declining, and there are schemes on foot among the
Bedouins and certain members of the Ibn Saoud family, for
starting a new pretender in the person of one of the sons of
Saoud, and claiming the protection of England.&nbsp; The power of
the Ibn Saoud family in Arabia may, however, be considered at an
end.</p>
<p>Hasa and the seaboard from Katr to Queyt is now held by the
Turks, under whose system of stirring up tribal feuds among the
Arabs, the commercial prosperity of the coast is rapidly
disappearing.&nbsp; Piracy, under the protection of the Ottoman
flag, has once more become the mode of life with the coast
villagers, and intrigues have been opened with the Sheykhs of the
districts eastwards, to induce them to accept similar protection
on the promise of similar license.</p>
<p>Meanwhile all that is truly national in thought and
respectable in feeling in central Arabia, is grouping itself
around Mohammed Ibn Rashid, the Emir of Jebel Shammar, and it is
to Ha&iuml;l that we must look for a restoration, if such be
possible, of the ancient glories and prosperity of the Nejd
Empire.</p>

271</span>MEMORANDUM ON THE EUPHRATES VALLEY RAILWAY,</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">And its Kindred Schemes of Railway
Communication between The Mediterranean and the Persian
Gulf</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> now completed the whole
journey by land between Alexandretta and Bushire, the extreme
points usually mentioned as terminuses for a Perso-Mediterranean
Railway, and being, in so far, capable of estimating the real
resources of the countries such a railway would serve, I make no
apology for the few remarks I here offer on the subject.&nbsp; I
do so with the more confidence because I perceive that of the
many advocates these railway schemes have had, not one has taken
the trouble of thus travelling over the whole distance, and that
nearly all calculations made regarding them, are based on a
survey of a part only of the road.&nbsp; It is seldom indeed that
those who write or speak about a Euphrates valley railway, have
done more than cross that river at Bir, or that they carry their
arguments much beyond a choice of the most suitable Mediterranean
port for a terminus, a kind of reasoning sufficient, no doubt,
for the purpose before them, but in reality misleading.&nbsp; I
believe, that one and all of these schemes are based upon a
deficient knowledge of the facts.</p>
<p>A railway of this sort, to Englishmen, is naturally
attractive, and presents itself to them in a double aspect,
political and commercial.&nbsp; Politically it has been <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>represented
as an alternative route for troops to India, more expeditious
than that by Suez; commercially as a scheme that will open up a
rich but neglected country to the operations of trade.</p>
<p>With regard to the first I would remark first that, having
gone through the calculation carefully, I find that four days is
the total saving between London and Calcutta which a line of
railway from Scanderun or Tripoli to Bushire would effect, an
advantage quite inadequate to the risk of transhipment, and the
fatigue of a long desert journey; secondly that the Persian Gulf
is both hotter and less healthy than the Red Sea, and that the
Syrian ports of the Mediterranean are peculiarly liable to fever;
and thirdly that such a line could be used for the conveyance of
English troops, by permission only of whatever power might be in
possession of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>When I was in India last summer I made acquaintance with a
great number of British officials, and I was at some pains to
learn from them their views on this &ldquo;alternative
route.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will not say that their answers to my
questions were invariably the same, but I think I am making no
mistake in affirming, that the consensus of intelligent opinion
among them is wholly adverse to the notion.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Euphrates route,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;would be of exceedingly
little use to us.&nbsp; The mails, to be sure, would go that way,
and we should get our letters from England three or four days
sooner; but, politically speaking, the mails are a matter of less
consequence than they were.&nbsp; Nowadays all official work of
real importance is transacted by telegraph, and when the mails
come in afterwards, their interest has been forestalled.&nbsp; It
would matter little at Simla or Calcutta whether they had taken
three weeks or a fortnight on the road.&nbsp; Trade would
certainly benefit somewhat in this way, but Government very
little.&nbsp; As regards the sending of troops overland, there
could be no question of it, as long <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>as the Suez route was open; and if
England cannot keep the Suez route open, she had better give up
India at once.&nbsp; No Secretary at War would be so ill-advised
as to send troops, with the risk of cholera and over-fatigue, by
the land journey as long as they could be marched on board at
Plymouth, and landed fresh at Bombay.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
even in case of a new mutiny?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
even in a mutiny.&nbsp; People in England have no idea of the
meaning of a thousand-mile railway journey in desert
countries.&nbsp; For six months in the year no passengers would
go that way, except, maybe, an occasional officer on a three
months&rsquo; furlough.&nbsp; We should not take our wives and
children there at any time.&nbsp; The extra trouble and expense
have prevented most of us from making use of the Brindisi line,
which really saves us a week and avoids the Bay of Biscay; so we
certainly should not face the Persian Gulf for the sake of four
days.&nbsp; The Persian Gulf is hotter than the Red
Sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lastly, as to the strategical importance of the
Euphrates and Tigris districts to India, I found that these were
considered, even by the extremest advocates of conquest, quite
out of our line of march for many years to come.&nbsp; The
veriest Russophobe could not be made to believe, that a modern
army would attempt a march through any passes in Asia Minor, or
down any Euphrates valley, on India.</p>
<p>It may therefore be dismissed from our calculations that India
stands in need of a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian
Gulf.&nbsp; The political advantage, if advantage there be, would
lie solely with Turkey, or with whatever power may eventually
become master of Armenia and Kurdistan.</p>
<p>As a commercial speculation, the Euphrates railway scheme is,
I believe, equally delusive.&nbsp; The additional cost and risk
of transhipment would be an effectual bar to through traffic;
while local traffic alone, would be insufficient to secure the
financial success of the line.&nbsp; The Euphrates and Tigris
valleys are often represented as rich <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>agricultural districts, waiting only
the hand of the immigrant to become again what they were in
classic and even medi&aelig;val times.&nbsp; It is argued that
if, in the twelfth century, the Euphrates valley boasted such
towns as Rakka, Karkesia, and Balis, such towns may exist again,
and that a railway carried by that route to Bagdad, would surely
revive the ancient wealth of a naturally wealthy district.&nbsp;
But such an argument speedily vanishes on an examination of the
facts.</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; The Euphrates and Tigris valleys neither are nor
ever were rich agriculturally.&nbsp; As corn-growing districts
they cannot compare with the hill country immediately north of
them, with northern Syria, the Taurus, or Kurdistan.&nbsp; They
lie out of the reach of the regular winter rains, which cling to
the hills, and for this reason are almost entirely dependent on
irrigation for their fertility.&nbsp; At best, the Euphrates and
Tigris valleys, through which a railway would pass, are
inconsiderable strips of good land, hemmed in closely by a barren
desert, and incapable of lateral extension or development.&nbsp;
They are isolated, and have long ceased to lie on the track of
commerce.&nbsp; At the present day they contain no place of
importance, with the exception of the pilgrim shrines of Kerbela
and Meshhed Ali, and the decayed city of Bagdad, nor along the
greater part of their extent, more than a few villages, depending
for their subsistence on the date-palm.&nbsp; They are, moreover,
subject to the caprices of their great unmanageable rivers, which
at flood time wreck half the valleys.&nbsp; The Euphrates for 150
miles, passes without alluvial belt of any kind, through a quite
inhospitable desert, while lower down it loses itself in marshes
at least as valueless.&nbsp; The Tigris, from Mosul to Bagdad,
boasts but three inconsiderable villages, and from Bagdad to
Bussorah, a poor half dozen.&nbsp; The Montefik country on the
lower Euphrates, and the island enclosed within the Hindiyeh
Canal, are the only important corn-growing districts now
existing.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>2nd.&nbsp; The great plain of Irak, the ancient
Babylonia, is not only uncultivated now, but for the most part is
uncultivable.&nbsp; A vast portion of it has been overflowed by
the rivers, and converted into a swamp, while the rest is more
absolutely barren than even the desert itself.&nbsp; It would
seem that the water of the Tigris contains saltpetre in solution,
and the plain below Bagdad, in the neighbourhood of the river, is
in many places covered with a saltpetrous deposit, the result of
over-irrigation in ancient days.&nbsp; The soil would seem to
have been in some sort worked out.&nbsp; I believe, moreover,
that from the denudation since ancient times of Armenia, from
which the two rivers flow, their floods have become more sudden,
and the water supply less calculable, and that the vast
irrigation works from the Euphrates, which would be necessary
before the fertility of Irak could be restored to what it then
was, would still be liable to excessive flood and drought.</p>
<p>The ancient agricultural wealth of Babylonia was a purely
artificial thing, depending upon a gigantic system of irrigation
which has no parallel in anything now found in the world.&nbsp;
When these vast works were begun is not known; but it must have
been in an age of mankind when Asia was densely peopled and human
labour cheap.&nbsp; Indeed, we may feel sure that only compulsory
labour could have carried them out at all, for they would have
ruined any treasury at any rate of wages.&nbsp; This can hardly
be done again.&nbsp; There are no captive nations now to be
impressed; no treasury capable of providing the funds.&nbsp; We
see India, with its really great population, and its
comparatively great wealth, sinking under the burden of
irrigation works; and the miserable Arabs of Irak cannot be
called on to square their shoulders and carry this far greater
load.&nbsp; With all our knowledge, too, of engineering, there
would still be some risk of failure; for the Euphrates and the
Tigris are not rivers to be trifled with, as Midhat Pasha found
to his <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>cost.&nbsp; I think it more than probable that in the
day of Babylonian greatness, the flooding of both rivers was more
regular and less subject to disasters of drought and excess than
now.&nbsp; As I have said, the denudation of Armenia accounts,
perhaps, for the destruction of Irak.&nbsp; In any case it is
certain, that at the present moment the full energies of the
existing population are required to preserve their footing, not
to make new conquests on the river.&nbsp; Now, as I am writing,
Lower Mesopotamia is expecting famine from the failure of the
Tigris, for not an acre of wheat can be sown without its
flooding.&nbsp; Last year all hands were at work damming out the
Euphrates.&nbsp; These matters are worth considering.</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; In treating this question of Euphrates Valley
communication, it seems to be forgotten that not only the
circumstances of the Valley itself are changed, but those of all
the world of Asia adjoining it.</p>
<p>To understand the present position of Mesopotamia and its
adjacent lands, we must consider the history of their ruin.&nbsp;
In the days of ancient Rome, not only the shores of the
Mediterranean, African as well as European, but also all Western
Asia, were a densely peopled empire.&nbsp; Even the lands beyond
Roman jurisdiction were full of great cities, from Armenia,
through the central plateau of Asia, to the edge of China.&nbsp;
Land was everywhere taken up and everywhere of value, while a
great surplus population was constantly being pushed out into
poorer and still poorer districts by the struggle of life, until
hardly a habitable corner of the old world remained
unoccupied.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, then, that, with such a necessity for
elbow room, the Euphrates and Tigris Valleys were early seized
upon, and that at a later date, even poorer regions of the desert
were conquered from sterility, and forced into the work of
producing food.&nbsp; As long as Babylonia, and the kingdoms
which succeeded it, maintained their fertility, <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>these
valleys lay on the highway between them and Asia Minor.&nbsp;
Even so lately as the twelfth century, Benjamin of Tudela, a
Spanish Jew, found numerous large towns still flourishing in
Upper Mesopotamia.&nbsp; Palmyra, at that day, was still a
commercial city, containing with other inhabitants a population
of two thousand Jews.&nbsp; On the Upper Euphrates he mentions
five towns, and on the Tigris two or three.&nbsp; It must not,
however, for a moment be supposed that these cities owed their
wealth in any but a very small measure to agriculture.&nbsp;
Palmyra and El Haddr, the two most important, never could have
had more than a few cultivated acres attached to them, while the
towns on the rivers, though making full use of the alluvial
valleys, were essentially commercial.&nbsp; The high road between
Aleppo and Bagdad then passed down the Euphrates as far as
Kerkesia (Deyr?), whence striking across Mesopotamia to El Haddr,
it joined the Tigris at Tekrit.&nbsp; Along this line cities were
found at intervals, much as the posting-houses used to be found
upon our own highways, and with the same reason for their
existence.&nbsp; They gradually died, as these died, with the
diversion of traffic from their route.&nbsp; Palmyra and El
Haddr, which (to continue the posting-house metaphor) had no
paddocks attached to them, were the first to disappear; and then
one by one the river towns, which for a time had still struggled
on with the aid of their fields, died too.&nbsp; In the
thirteenth, and again in the sixteenth centuries, the terrible
scourges of Mongul and Ottoman conquests passed over Asia, and
swept the regions surrounding Mesopotamia clear of
inhabitants.&nbsp; All Western Asia was at this time ruined; and
the first result was the abandonment of outlying settlements,
which only the stress of over-population elsewhere had ever
brought into existence.&nbsp; The Tigris and Euphrates were
gradually abandoned, and only the richest districts of Armenia,
Kurdistan, and Syria retained.&nbsp; The Ottoman system of <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>misgovernment has done the rest; and now at the present
day there is no surplus population eastwards nearer than China,
which could supply the deficiency.&nbsp; Until Persia and Armenia
are fully occupied, it is idle to expect the comparatively waste
lands of Mesopotamia and the river banks to invite
immigration.&nbsp; Russia may some day assimilate Asia Minor, and
Asia Minor may some day again become populous, but until that is
done Mesopotamia must wait.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Europe is as little likely to send
emigrants to the banks of the Euphrates.&nbsp; With such large
tracts of good land on the southern shores of the Mediterranean
and in Syria, unoccupied, there is nothing to tempt
agriculturists to poorer lands so far away.&nbsp; Mesopotamia has
hardly a climate suited to northern Europeans, while Italians and
Maltese (the only southern nations with a surplus population)
find openings nearer home.&nbsp; It is equally idle to talk of
coolies from India, or coolies from China.&nbsp; These only
emigrate, on the prospect of immediate high wages, to countries
where labour commands its full price, and capital is there to
employ it.&nbsp; As mere emigrants in search of land they will
not come.</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; Although South-western Persia, through which the
last 400 miles of a railroad to Bushire might be made to pass,
has not suffered from the same physical causes which have ruined
Babylonia, its present condition as regards population,
production, and existing wealth, are hardly less
unfortunate.&nbsp; The government of Persia, which burlesques all
that we most complain of in Turkey, has succeeded in reducing the
production of a district, one of the wealthiest in natural
advantages of all Asia, practically to nothing.&nbsp; With the
single exception of a tract of cultivated land lying between
Dizful and Shustar, and another between Dilam and Bushire, the
railway would pass through a country at present uninhabited even
by wandering tribes possessed of pastoral wealth.&nbsp; The
policy of the Persian government <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>in its dealings with Arabistan has
been to depopulate, as the shortest and easiest mode of governing
it, and the policy has been successful.</p>
<p>Still I consider, that a railway run along the edge of the
Bactiari hills, would have a far better chance of attracting
population towards it, than one in the Euphrates or Tigris
valleys.&nbsp; The soil is naturally a very rich one, and the
winter rainfall sufficient for agricultural purposes.&nbsp;
Where-ever cultivation exists it is remunerative, and the soil
has not been worked out, as is the case in the plains.&nbsp; The
line would doubtless serve the better peopled districts of
Shirazd and Luristan; and Bebaban, Shustar and Dizful, would
become once more important <i>entrep&ocirc;ts</i> for the wealth
of the interior.&nbsp; With the security a railway would give,
immigrants might even gradually arrive, and it is conceivable
that the district might in the course of years be reclaimed, for
it is well worth reclaiming, but the prospect is a distant
one.</p>
<p>On the whole I would suggest that all calculations as to
traffic should be based strictly on existing circumstances.&nbsp;
It may be, that the present population and production are
sufficient for the support of a railway, (I myself considerably
doubt it), but investors should trust to these only.&nbsp; The
future has only delusions in store for them.&nbsp; It is idle to
quote the precedent of those American railways, carried through
waste places, which have speedily attracted population, and
through population, wealth.&nbsp; In Asia there is no surplus
population anywhere to attract.&nbsp; Moreover there are existing
circumstances of misgovernment, which no system of railways can
cure, and till these are changed, it is idle to hope for other
changes.&nbsp; Railways in Europe or in America, serve the
interests of the people.&nbsp; In Turkey or in Persia they would
serve the interests of their rulers only.</p>
<p>That readers may judge what the actual condition is, of the
lands lying between the Mediterranean and the Persian <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>Gulf, I
have put in tabular form the amount of cultivated and
uncultivated land, of pasture and desert, afforded by the various
lines of route which have been suggested for a railway.&nbsp;

<p>This route has nothing to recommend it except its
shortness.&nbsp; It would pass through but one considerable town,
Homs; it would serve no important agricultural district, and
could count upon no local traffic.&nbsp; The greater part of its
course is without water, fuel, inhabitants, or possibility of
development.&nbsp; It would require considerable cutting and
bridging (for ravines), and would have little strategical
value.</p>

line passes through one town of eighty thousand inhabitants,
Aleppo, and two small towns, Deyr and Ana, besides a few
villages.&nbsp; It could count on very little local traffic; Deyr
might export a little corn, Ana a few dates.&nbsp; Except in the
northern portion it is not a sheep district.&nbsp; It has the
advantages of water and fuel, but these would be to a certain
extent neutralised if, as is probable, the line should have to
pass along the desert above, instead of in the valley.&nbsp; In
either case the construction would not be without expense, the
river with its inundations causing constant obstruction below;
while the desert above, is much broken with ravines.&nbsp; It
could hardly pay the whole of its working expenses.&nbsp; Its
principal advantage is, that in case of its being continued from
Seglawieh to Bussorah, some miles would be saved, or a branch
line might be made to Kerbela.&nbsp; The Euphrates line is
strategically of advantage to Turkey, mainly as a check on the
Bedouin tribes.</p>

<p>This line has the advantage of passing through no absolutely
desert district.&nbsp; It would be well watered throughout, and
in the Tigris Valley would have a supply of fuel.&nbsp; It would,
as far as Mosul, serve four large towns with an aggregate
population of two hundred thousand inhabitants, besides numerous
villages, and a nearly continuous <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>agricultural population.&nbsp; Its
stations would serve as depots for the produce of Upper Syria,
Armenia, and Kurdistan from the north, and of a fairly prosperous
pastoral district from the south.&nbsp; Below Mosul, however,
there would be but two small towns, Samara, and Tekrit, and
hardly a village.&nbsp; The engineering difficulties of this
route, in spite of several small rivers besides the Euphrates
(which all three lines would have to cross), would probably be
less than in the others.&nbsp; Upper Mesopotamia is a more even
plain than the Syrian Desert, and southwards is but little
intersected with ravines.&nbsp; This route is strategically of
immense importance to Turkey, and is perhaps the best.&nbsp; I
would, however, suggest, that commercially, a better line would
be from Mosul by Kerkuk to Bagdad.&nbsp; This would continue
through cultivated lands, and is the route recommended by the
very intelligent Polish engineer, who surveyed it some years
ago.</p>
<p>Beyond Bagdad the routes to the Persian Gulf would
be&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Bagdad to Queyt by right bank of Euphrates, serving
Kerbela, Meshhed Ali, and the district of Suk-esh-Shiokh (460
miles) or to Bussorah (400 miles).</p>
<p>This could be continued from Seglawieh, thereby saving fifty
miles.&nbsp; It would serve two fairly flourishing agricultural
districts, and should pass along the edge of the desert where the
ground is nearly level.&nbsp; Queyt is a good port as to
anchorage, but has no commercial importance.&nbsp; Bussorah is a
river port much circumscribed by marshes.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Bagdad to Mohamra by the left bank of the Tigris (320
miles).</p>
<p>This would be a difficult line to make, on account of the
marshes, and would pass through a nearly uninhabited
country.&nbsp; It has no advantage but its shortness.</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>3.&nbsp; Bagdad to Bushire, along the edge of the
Hamrin Hills to Dizful, then by Shustar, Ram Hormuz, and Dilam
(570 miles).</p>
<p>This line would be an expensive one, on account of the six
large rivers it would have to cross, but it presents no other
engineering difficulties.&nbsp; It should keep close under the
Hamrin Hills to avoid marshy ground near the river.&nbsp; It is
uninhabited as far as Dizful, though the soil is good and well
watered.&nbsp; Dizful and Shustar are important commercial towns,
being the principal markets of South Western Persia; the district
between them is well cultivated.&nbsp; Beyond Shustar to Dilam
there is but one inhabited place, Ram Hormuz (or Ramuz).&nbsp;
There are a few villages along the shore of the Persian Gulf to
Bushire, but very little cultivation.&nbsp; This route might be
shortened by taking a direct line from Ali Ghurbi on the Tigris
to Dilam, but it would then pass wholly through uninhabited
country, swampy in places.&nbsp; On the whole I prefer the
Dizful-Shustar route, as having better commercial
prospects.&nbsp; These towns would supply no little
traffic.&nbsp; Bushire is an important place, and would make the
best terminus for a railway on the Gulf.&nbsp; I cannot, however,
recommend any of these lines south of Bagdad as commercially
promising for a railway.</p>

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
